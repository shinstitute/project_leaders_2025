organization: Oak Ridge National Laboratory
title: Surrogate models for materials science
topics: Computational Science Applications (i.e., bioscience, cosmology, chemistry,
  environmental science, nanotechnology, climate, etc.); Computer Science (i.e., architectures,
  compilers/languages, networks, workflow/edge, experiment automation, containers,
  neuromorphic computing, programming models, operating systems, sustainable software);
  Data Science (i.e., data analytics, data management &amp; storage systems, visualization);
  High-Performance Computing; Machine Learning and AI
abstract: Material design and discovery are crucial for the US Department of Energy
  (DOE) in order to advance energy technologies, improving efficiency, and addressing
  sustainability and environmental challenges. Exploring the space characterized by
  different materials is extremely complex due to the myriad of possibilities to mix
  different natural elements at different percentages. Such exploration is impractical
  given traditional technologies. In fact, laboratory experiments are labor-intensive,
  and physics computational models require massive computational resources. Both experimental
  and computational approaches preclude an effective (fast and thorough) exploration
  of several materials. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) enable
  an effective exploration of a several materials within a fraction of the time required
  by traditional experimental and computational methodologies. This internship offers
  the opportunity to become acquainted with the scientific challenges that the US-DOE
  is facing to achieve materials design and discovery, and appreciate the advantages
  that AI and ML can provide to this field.
