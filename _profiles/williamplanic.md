department: Computer Science
project_title: Epilepsy Foresight Toolkit
status: Accept (Confirmed)
abstract: The Epilepsy Foresight Toolkit is designed to be a comprehensive suite for
  analysis and research through data-driven insights. Users can directly upload datasets
  or access publicly available clinical trains or electronic health records for interpretation.
  Two predictive models, AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Long
  Short-Term Memory (LSTM) are used to forecast trends and epilepsy incidents for
  analyzing time-series data. The toolkitâ€™s interface supports a variety of operations
  including report generation, data preprocessing, secure storage, and viewing reports
  or data. Exploratory data analysis offers insights into patterns and trends in epilepsy
  data with the goal of providing crucial information to clinicians and researchers
  to improve epilepsy patient outcomes.
academic_interests: My academic and research interests center on artificial intelligence,
  with a focus on mechanistic interpretability and deep learning. I am particularly
  interested in understanding decision-making processes of large neural networks along
  with their internal representations. Through this understanding I hope to make these
  systems more reliable and transparent. I am also interested in anonymization and
  data privacy techniques, focusing specifically on their integration into machine
  learning pipelines while maintaining model performance. My interests include exploring
  various methods such as synthetic data generation and differential privacy to safeguard
  data while enabling practical AI applications.
motivation: I am interested in attending the US-RSE25 conference through the Building
  Engagement program because I see it as a unique opportunity to learn and connect
  with the research software engineering community. Attending US-RSE25 would allow
  me to share my perspective from AI research while gaining insights from others who
  are also advancing RSE practices across various scientific domains. I am drawn to
  the community-building aspect of this program. As someone who is very early in their
  career, I want to develop connections with collaborations, peers, and mentors who
  share similar interests. Participating in US-RSE25 would help me grow as both a
  software engineer and a researcher while contributing to the shared goal of strengthening
  the RSE community.
