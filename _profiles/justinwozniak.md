topics: Computer Science (i.e., architectures, compilers/languages, networks, workflow/edge,
  experiment automation, containers, neuromorphic computing, programming models, operating
  systems, sustainable software)
abstract: 'High Performance Computing (HPC) workflows combine physical simulations
  with machine learning and other analysis to address scientific problems in modeling
  the spread of COVID-19, designing precision cancer treatments, and other areas.
  The Swift/T workflow language is designed to run on the largest available supercomputers
  and integrate complex, parallel software packages under the control of a high-level
  dataflow language. Optimizing and debugging such workflows is difficult. There are
  range of tools developed by the computer science community to analyze the performance
  and correctness of such software systems. In this project, the team will apply one
  or more such systems to Swift/T workflows in a scientific application area. The
  team will run Swift/T in a simulated environment using a distributed computing simulator
  such as SimGrid/SMPI to evaluate correctness and performance. Technical details:
  Swift/T is a parallel programming language that uses a Java-based programming language
  translator to generate code for a C and MPI -based runtime. Swift/T can distributed
  and run user scientific codes written in any language, but Python and R modules
  are a popular choice. The system is an excellent environment in which to learn about
  programming language design/implementation, distributed computing, and systems software
  in general.'
