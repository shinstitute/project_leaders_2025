abstract: To reduce human error in creating input files for simulations, especially
  when handling hundreds or even thousands of jobs, we developed a robust and versatile
  Python framework to streamline the generation and analysis of large-scale simulation
  datasets for various executables. This framework automates the creation, submission,
  and execution of simulations, significantly reducing the time spent on preparing,
  copying, and submitting input files, executables, and additional parameters (such
  as potentials). This approach has greatly improved the efficiency and accuracy of
  simulations, especially on Perlmutter, a NERSC supercomputer, though it is adaptable
  for use on other systems as well can be adapted to another computing. This framework
  was deployed on Perlmutter, a supercomputer delivered to the National Energy Research
  Scientific Computing Center (NERSC), with successful results and is adaptable to
  other computing platforms.
academic_interests: "Over the past two years, my research has centered on computational
  physics, with a particular focus on developing tools and codes to address physics
  problems. I am especially interested in applying these approaches to materials science,
  such as determining the mechanical and thermal properties of novel materials. To
  tackle these challenges, I rely on numerical methods and machine learning, as well
  as simulation techniques like molecular dynamics (MD) and density functional theory
  (DFT) for property extraction. I prefer not to treat scientific software as a â€œblack
  box.â€\x9D Instead, I actively study the documentation and underlying implementations,
  which has led me to learn coding languages such as C++ and Fortran, the same languages
  in which much of this software is developed. This deeper understanding allows me
  to customize and extend existing tools for my research."
motivation: I am motivated to attend because several colleagues and members of my
  research group who previously participated in this program have shared their experiences
  with me. They emphasized how fruitful and enriching it was, highlighting not only
  the high-quality workshops and talks but also the excellent networking opportunities.
  Hearing how impactful this program has been for them reinforces my enthusiasm to
  take part and to benefit from the same combination of technical learning, professional
  development, and community building. This program appeals to me because it emphasizes
  community building and engagement. As someone who has participated in student societies
  and collaborative research projects, I value the role of networks in creating opportunities
  to exchange ideas, learn best practices, and foster innovation. I am eager to connect
  with other researchers and engineers at US-RSE25, learn from their experiences,
  and contribute my own perspective as a computational physics scientist.

## Academic Interests

Over the past two years, my research has centered on computational physics, with a particular focus on developing tools and codes to address physics problems. I am especially interested in applying these approaches to materials science, such as determining the mechanical and thermal properties of novel materials. To tackle these challenges, I rely on numerical methods and machine learning, as well as simulation techniques like molecular dynamics (MD) and density functional theory (DFT) for property extraction. I prefer not to treat scientific software as a â€œblack box.â€ Instead, I actively study the documentation and underlying implementations, which has led me to learn coding languages such as C++ and Fortran, the same languages in which much of this software is developed. This deeper understanding allows me to customize and extend existing tools for my research.
