title: Probabilistic Machine Learning for Scientific Data
topics: Machine Learning and AI
abstract: 'ome unique challenges in scientific data that needs to be considered while
  building data-driven models are: (1) noise and uncertainty, (2) data scarcity, and
  (3) large feature spaces. Probabilistic models are a natural choice to address many
  of these challenges and provide a systematic approach to reason about the prediction
  uncertainty. Historically, the adoption of probabilistic modeling approaches has
  been limited by the scalability of the inference approaches. With the recent advances
  in Bayesian deep learning, approximate inference approaches and their information-theoretic
  connections have enabled inference on large-scale (with millions of parameters)
  models efficiently with modest computational requirements, obtaining state-of-the-art
  predictive accuracy. This project would involve building such probabilistic deep
  learning models for applications such as equilibrium reconstruction of plasma profiles
  in a magnetically confined fusion tokamak and detecting strong gravitational lenses
  from astronomical observations from telescopes.'
