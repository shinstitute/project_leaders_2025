title: Particle-based performance comparisons with Cabana
topics: Computational Science Applications (i.e., bioscience, cosmology, chemistry,
  environmental science, nanotechnology, climate, etc.); High-Performance Computing
abstract: Particles (just points in a box) can be used to simulate a huge range of
  different processes and phenomena, from atoms to galaxies. Because there are so
  many similarities in writing simulation codes, improving the computational performance
  of those codes, and making sure the physics is correct (even with very different
  physics), we created a library to manage particles called Cabana. Cabana is made
  for high-performance computing (HPC) particle codes on all the hardware architectures
  (GPUs, etc.) across Department of Energy (using the Kokkos and MPI libraries). This
  project would focus on comparing the performance of recent Cabana applications on
  HPC platforms (or even potentially building a new Cabana-based code for a method
  of interest). Recent codes have focused heat transport, fracture and failure in
  materials, plasma physics, cosmology, and atomic behavior.
