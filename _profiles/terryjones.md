title: Memory Tools for High Performance Computing
topics: Computer Science (i.e., architectures, compilers/languages, networks, workflow/edge,
  experiment automation, containers, neuromorphic computing, programming models, operating
  systems, sustainable software); High-Performance Computing
abstract: The recent emergence of new memory technologies and multi-tier memory architectures
  has disrupted the traditional view of memory as a single block of volatile storage
  with uniform performance. Several options for managing data on heterogeneous memory
  platforms now exist, but current approaches either rely on inflexible, and often
  inefficient, hardware-based caching, or they require expert knowledge and source
  code modification to utilize the different performance and capabilities within each
  memory tier. We are researching a new software-based framework to collect and apply
  memory management guidance for applications on heterogeneous memory platforms. The
  framework, together with new tools, combines a generic runtime API with automated
  program profiling and analysis to achieve data management that is both efficient
  and portable across multiple memory architectures.
