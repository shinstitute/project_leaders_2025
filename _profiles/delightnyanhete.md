department: Computer Science and Mathematics
status: Accept (Confirmed)
academic_interests: I always knew Computer Science would be my major, but it was not
  until I arrived in the United States that I truly understood the potential of Artificial
  Intelligence. During my first visit to Atlanta, I experienced the automated Plane
  Train at Hartsfield Jackson Airport. Watching driverless trains navigate smoothly
  between terminals without human intervention was eye opening. It showed me how Artificial
  Intelligence and automation were already transforming systems in practical ways,
  and it sparked my interest in exploring how these technologies can solve complex
  challenges. Since then, my coursework has given me a strong foundation in programming,
  data structures, and algorithms. I have also looked for ways to apply theory through
  projects. In Harvest Shield, I developed convolutional neural network models using
  VGG16, training on one hundred and sixty thousand images to classify plants and
  detect pests with over ninety five percent accuracy. This experience deepened my
  understanding of Artificial Intelligence in agriculture. At the Arkansas Summer
  Research Institute, I analyzed earthquake data with Python libraries, which strengthened
  my skills in scientific data analysis. At the Texas Advanced Computing Center, I
  worked on an Alzheimerâ€™s machine learning application and trained models on Stampede3,
  my first exposure to high performance computing. Looking forward, I am eager to
  explore the intersection of computer vision, Artificial Intelligence, robotics,
  and high performance computing. I want to develop intelligent systems that perceive
  and adapt to their environment, with applications in transportation, healthcare,
  disaster relief, and agriculture.
motivation: I am eager to get practical research experience. My university is a teaching
  school, so most of what I have been exposed to is classroom based, in the same environment
  and setting. I feel geographically limited when it comes to access to labs and real
  research spaces, so most of what I know is theory. I want to actually see how the
  knowledge I have gained applies to real projects. Even learning the right terminology
  is something I am looking forward to, because I always tell my colleagues that I
  need to learn in a way that makes me feel I am truly in the field. Because I have
  had to teach myself and look for opportunities on my own, I know I need to attend
  programs like this to grow further. Meeting different people, mentors, and students
  from other places, and hearing what they are working on, will give me new pictures
  and trajectories of what I could do in this vast field of Computing.
