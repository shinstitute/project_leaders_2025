abstract: One promising strategy in scientific machine learning seeks to obtain a
  PDE description of a physical system by inferring the PDEâ€™s operators directly
  from observations of the system. Ideally, a modeler would also enforce a priori
  known physics constraints such as conservation and symmetries to guarantee the model
  is at least physically valid. However, observational data is always noisy and sparse,
  so learned operators are only useful insofar as their uncertainties have been properly
  quantified. Without these measures, an analyst using the models cannot determine
  in which regimes the model is valid. The staff members have previously developed
  methods for learning uncertainty aware operators. The intern will focus on combining
  these operators with physics informed constraints and studying the interaction.
  While the methods developed will be broadly applicable, we will focus on two exemplars,
  crack propagation of a composite under shear loading and climate forcing under volcanic
  eruption. This topic will blend together ideas from a variety of subjects, e.g.,
  PDEs, statistics, machine learning, solid mechanics, and climatology.
