title: Learning while optimizing
topics: Computational Science Applications (i.e., bioscience, cosmology, chemistry,
  environmental science, nanotechnology, climate, etc.); Data Science (i.e., data
  analytics, data management &amp; storage systems, visualization); Machine Learning
  and AI
abstract: Our research addresses mathematical optimization of challenging computational
  science problems. We will be exploring ways that we can use machine learning on
  the data generated internally by an optimization algorithm in order to improve its
  performance on a chosen application.
