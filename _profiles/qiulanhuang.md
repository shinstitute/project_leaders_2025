title: Data Popularity and Data placement Optimization for big data Analysis
topics: Data Science (i.e., data analytics, data management &amp; storage systems,
  visualization); Machine Learning and AI
abstract: Scientific experiments and computations, especially those in NP &amp; HEP
  programs, are generating and accumulating data at an unprecedented rate. Big data
  provides opportunities for new scientific discoveries. Nevertheless, for the Scientific
  Data and Computing Center , managing the vast amount of data cost-effectively while
  enabling efficient data analysis in a large-scale, multi-tiered storage architecture
  is a real challenge. The topic revolves around the exploration and development of
  techniques aimed at comprehending data popularity and optimizing data access. Through
  studying data access patterns, doing data analytics, we can identify frequently
  accessed datasets, prioritize their availability and subsequently design a policy
  engine to enhance resource allocation for analytical tasks. This research topic
  assumes critical importance in today's data-driven world, as it holds the potential
  to significantly improve data analysis efficiency, enhance decision-making processes,
  and fuel innovation across a diverse range of domains.
