title: Machine Learning for Jobs queue Wait time prediction
topics: Computational Science Applications (i.e., bioscience, cosmology, chemistry,
  environmental science, nanotechnology, climate, etc.); Computer Science (i.e., architectures,
  compilers/languages, networks, workflow/edge, experiment automation, containers,
  neuromorphic computing, programming models, operating systems, sustainable software);

abstract: The era of supercomputing and data science presents novel challenges and
  opportunities. Supercomputers such as Cori and Perlmutter, with their incredible
  processing power, are often tasked with running numerous complex jobs concurrently.
  Efficient management of these jobs, especially determining their queue wait times,
  is critical to optimizing the system's overall performance. This project, titled
  "Queue Wait Time Prediction of Perlmutter, aimed to address this very issue.
