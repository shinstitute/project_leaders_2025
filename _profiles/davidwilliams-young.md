name: David Williams-Young
organization: Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
title: Enabling the Next Generation Quantum Simulations with Modern High-Performance
  Computing
topics: Computational Science Applications (i.e., bioscience, cosmology, chemistry,
  environmental science, nanotechnology, climate, etc.); High-Performance Computing
abstract: In this research, we will develop novel methods for the efficient solution
  of the quantum many-body problem by leveraging the latest advances in modern high-performance
  computing and sparse numerical linear algebra. Key applications of this work will
  be accelerating scientific simulations in computational chemistry, nuclear physics,
  high-energy physics and quantum information science, each of which hold significant
  potential to advance our understanding of the universe and the fundamental physical
  laws that govern it. Researchers will gain hands-on experience in these and related
  fields and work in a highly-collaborative environment, on-site at Lawrence Berkeley
  National Lab.
