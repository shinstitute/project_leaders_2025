name: Emil Constantinescu
organization: Argonne National Laboratory
title: Physics-based machine learning and uncertainty quantification
topics: Machine Learning and AI
abstract: This project aims to advance computational science by integrating numerical
  methods for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) with machine learning
  and statistics for uncertainty quantification. Traditional simulation models have
  limitations in capturing complex behaviors inherent in systems like weather forecasting,
  climate modeling, power grid management, and nuclear physics. By incorporating machine
  learning algorithms into the numerical solving of PDEs, we aspire to build more
  accurate and efficient simulation models. Additionally, we will employ statistical
  methods for uncertainty quantification to provide more reliable predictions and
  to understand the range of possible outcomes. The ultimate goal is to develop a
  unified computational framework that is versatile enough for applications in various
  disciplines, from predicting severe weather events to optimizing power grid operations
  and advancing our understanding of nuclear physics phenomena. We want to explore
  new approaches to modeling complex systems, offering more accurate and reliable
  predictions for scientific inquiry and practical applications.
