biography: Haohan Wang is an assistant professor in the School of Information Sciences
  at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. His research focuses on the development
  of trustworthy machine learning methods for computational biology and healthcare
  applications, such as decoding the genomic language of Alzheimer's disease. In his
  work, he uses statistical analysis and deep learning methods, with an emphasis on
  data analysis using methods least influenced by spurious signals. Wang earned his
  PhD in computer science through the Language Technologies Institute of Carnegie
  Mellon University where he works with Professor Eric Xing. In 2019, Wang was recognized
  as the Next Generation in Biomedicine by the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard
  because of his contributions in dealing with confounding factors with deep learning.
project_title: 'Toward Redefining Disease Taxonomy: Scaling Transcriptomic Analysis
  with Agentic AI Systems'
nairr_project: 'Toward Redefining Disease Taxonomy: Scaling Transcriptomic Analysis
  with Agentic AI Systems'
topical_areas: Basic Medicine; Biochemistry and Molecular Biology; Health Sciences
abstract: The project aims to redefine how diseases are classified by using agentic
  artificial intelligence—a new generation of self-revising, collaborative AI systems—to
  analyze large-scale human transcriptomic data. Today’s biomedical research relies
  on rigid pipelines that struggle to integrate data across tissues, populations,
  and rare conditions. We will build an AI framework composed of autonomous reasoning
  agents that continuously analyze and validate public datasets, learning to correct
  themselves and adapt to missing metadata or unexpected patterns. These agents will
  uncover disease relationships directly from molecular signals rather than from pre-defined
  diagnostic categories. The outcome is a data-driven taxonomy of disease—linking
  common and rare conditions through shared regulatory signatures—that could reshape
  how medicine understands biological variability. Students will join a cross-disciplinary
  team at the intersection of AI, computational biology, and open science, contributing
  to a system that learns science itself.
desired_skills: We welcome students from computer science, data science, biology,
  or related fields who are curious about how AI can advance scientific discovery.
  Interest in coding, statistics, or genomics is helpful but not required. The most
  important traits are curiosity, persistence, and comfort working across disciplines.
  Experience with Python, R, or machine learning frameworks is a plus, but students
  can learn these skills during the project.
comments: Students will gain experience working with large biological datasets and
  intelligent systems that operate autonomously. The environment emphasizes mentorship,
  open collaboration, and publication-quality research. Outstanding participants may
  continue with the lab through independent study or joint conference submissions.
