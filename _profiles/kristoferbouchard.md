title: Foundation model for proteins
topics: Computational Science Applications (i.e., bioscience, cosmology, chemistry,
  environmental science, nanotechnology, climate, etc.)
abstract: Foundation models are massive (&gt;1B parameters) deep networks that have
  been pre-trained on large and diverse data sets and can then be transfer-learned
  to other relevant tasks. Salient examples include GPT-4, DALL-E2, etc., While this
  class of models has been impactful in industrial applications, foundation models
  for science are nascent. Proteins are fundamental units of biological processes.
  This project will build of diverse extent work across LBL to create a foundation
  model that integrates all known protein structure and sequences. This protein foundation
  model could then be used as the basis for, e.g., generating novel protein sequences
  with enhanced functionality, inferring atomic structure from SAXS data, or inferring
  the function of newly discovered proteins.
