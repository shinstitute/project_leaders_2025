biography: Andrew joined Berkeley Lab in 2013 as a postdoctoral researcher in the
  Applied Numerical Algorithms Group. He is now a staff member in the Center for Computational
  Sciences and Engineering, where he designs and implements HPC algorithms for solving
  multiscale, multiphysics problems using structured adaptive meshes and particles.
  He is a core contributor to the AMReX adaptive mesh library, and also contributes
  to a number of AMReX-based simulation codes in subjects ranging from computational
  plasma physics to epidemiology. He was a member of the 2022 Gordon-Bell prize-winning
  team for kinetic plasma simulations with the WarpX Particle-in-Cell code, and received
  a Director's Award for Exceptional Scientific Achievement in 2023.

abstract: 'AMReX is a publicly available software framework designed for building
  massively parallel block- structured adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) applications.
  Simulation codes based on AMReX model a wide range phenomena from fields ranging
  from astrophysics and cosmology to plasma physics, earth systems modeling, multi-phase
  flow, epidemiology, cell biology, and more. While AMReX is written in C++, for this
  internship we are envisioning several projects that involve improving and expanding
  the Python interfaces to AMReX with the goal of supporting new AI/ML use cases,
  including: 1. Integrating simulations with ML-based Bayesian optimization workflows
  2. Training fast surrogate models and incorporating those into simulations 3. Automatic
  differentiation of coupled C++ simulation and Python analysis code through tools
  like Enzyme. 4. Uncertainty quantification using frameworks like PyTUQ. The above
  workflows will be demonstrated on and evaluated with real-world AMReX-based application
  codes.'
desired_skills: Experience with Python is desired, other useful skills include experience
  with C++, AI/ML, and high-performance computing.
