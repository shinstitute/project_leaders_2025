project_title: Novel Exascale & AI Workflows with WarpX
hpsf_project: WarpX
topical_areas: Applied Computer Science; Applied Mathematics; Fluid and Plasma Physics;
  High Performance Computing; Open Source Software; Particle and High-Energy Physics;
  Performance Evaluation and Benchmarking; Software Engineering
abstract: 'We are envisioning several projects that involve improving and expanding
  the performance or scientific workflows using WarpX, including: 1. Parallel data
  post-processing with DASK and openPMD. 2. Automatic differentiation of C++ simulations
  through tools like Enzyme. 3. Implementation of numerical algorithms for the modeling
  of plasmas, lasers, and particle beams, with applications in fusion and/or accelerator
  physics. 4. Training fast AI/ML surrogate models. Incorporate those into simulations,
  integrated research infrastructures, updating models in real-time from experimental
  and simulation data as they become available, and/or informing operation in experiments.
  The above implementations and workflows will be demonstrated on and evaluated with
  WarpX simulations in fusion and particle accelerator physics.'
desired_skills: We are looking for people interested in developing new code (C++,
  Python), implement numerics, or new workflows to address timely challenges in fusion
  and particle accelerator science. Ideally, you already have experience with C++,
  Python and Git/GitHub and are eager to be embedded in an open, interdisciplinary
  team.
