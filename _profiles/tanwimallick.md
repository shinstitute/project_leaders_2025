title: Spatiotemporal modeling using machine learning techniques
topics: Machine Learning and AI
abstract: Many real-world phenomena, such as traffic flow on road networks, data transfer
  on the HPC Interconnect Network, load balancing in power grids, and regional rainfall,
  are spatiotemporal in nature. These complex systems are dynamic, evolving over both
  time and space. For the aforementioned scientific studies, it is critical to accurately
  predict the future behaviors of these spatiotemporal systems, cluster the data into
  meaningful groups to unveil different patterns and anomalies and accelerate spatiotemporal
  models by optimizing their performance and reducing computation time. In this project,
  we aim to develop and fine-tune a machine learning model for enhanced spatiotemporal
  modeling, targeting real-world phenomena like traffic flow, HPC Interconnect Network
  traffic, and regional rainfall.
