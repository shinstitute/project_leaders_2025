title: Modeling and Control of Particle Accelerator Beams using Bayesian Neural Networks
topics: Machine Learning and AI
abstract: 'Particle accelerators are a central tool for scientific discovery, from
  unraveling the governing laws of fundamental particles, to understanding the universe''s
  origins. Brookhaven National Laboratory is home to the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider
  (RHIC) and the future Electron Ion Collider (EIC), two world-leading particle accelerators.
  At RHIC, which is the largest particle accelerator in the United States, scientists
  are currently studying the properties of subatomic particles. Specifically, researchers
  use particle collisions to recreate extreme conditions like those shortly after
  the Big Bang: the prevailing theory for the origins of our universe. Both cutting-edge
  accelerator experiments rely on complex particle beam controls (e.g., altering trajectories)
  to create collisions that generate useful data. Ensuring the accuracy and reliability
  of particle collision experiments is of critical importance and requires the development
  of robust beam control methodologies. In this research project, we will build a
  data-driven model of beam position using Bayesian neural networks (BNNs). BNNs are
  machine learning models that provide accurate predictions while also quantifying
  the error inherent in the data, ensuring robust and reliable beam position forecasts.
  The student intern working on this project will gain practical experience in cutting-edge
  machine learning topics as applied to a real high-energy physics application.'
