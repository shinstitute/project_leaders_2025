  High-Performance Computing
abstract: LANL's Venado, the first NVIDIA Grace-Hopper supercomputer in the US, will
  be ready in early 2024. NVIDIA's Grace-Hopper integrates its latest Grace CPU and
  H100 GPU on the same chip for faster CPU-GPU data movement, and Venado provides
  an exotic liquid cooling system for maximized system performance and reliability.
  To run large-scale simulations using GPUs on Venado, conventional HPC programming
  solutions include the mix of CUDA (GPU programming) and MPI (node communication),
  and the Kokkos ecosystem. However, these solutions usually require significant programming
  (e.g., C++ and MPI) and hardware expertise (e.g., GPU architecture). To strengthen
  LANL's HPC productivity on the rapidly evolving heterogeneous supercomputers with
  GPUs, we will evaluate an innovative HPC programming paradigm, programming physics
  simulations using NumPy, by accelerating LANL's physics simulations on hundreds
  of Venado GPU nodes.
