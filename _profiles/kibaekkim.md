title: Federated Learning at Edge
topics: Machine Learning and AI
abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a method where multiple devices train machine
  learning models locally on their own data, and then collaboratively refine a shared
  model by exchanging updates, without directly sharing the actual data. This project
  aims to address the technical challenges by developing and deploying FL models to
  the edge devices available through Argonne National Laboratory. Closely working
  with multiple scientists at the lab, the participants will develop, analyze, and
  test the FL model and training algorithms on high-performance computing cluster
  first and then on the edge devices.
