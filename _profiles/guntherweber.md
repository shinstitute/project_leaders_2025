abstract: Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) is a growing research area that uses
  innovative machine learning solutions to obtain scientific insights from large data
  sets. Understanding these novel tools requires analyzing high-dimensional functions
  that have properties very different from those seen in other, more traditional DOE
  applications. For example, the features of a loss as a function of neural network
  (NN) weights provide valuable insights into properties of architectures that affect
  convergence during training. Compared to high-dimensional functions in other DOE-relevant
  applications, such as potential energy landscapes in chemistry, ML loss landscapes
  have many more dimensionsâ€”millions or billions of weights compared to tens or
  hundreds of degrees of freedom for molecules. Initial work within the ML community
  on visualizing loss landscapes has shown great promise, e.g., by relating NN architecture
  choices to the smoothness of the function being optimized during the learning process.
  More sophisticated visualization techniques can provide a much deeper understanding
  of the properties of NNs, which is particularly important for SciML problems. The
  goal of this project is to develop new visualization and data analysis approaches,
  e.g., based on topological data analysis, to help better understand these functions
  and as a result SciML models.
