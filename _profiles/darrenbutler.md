project_title: Fostering Psychological Safety in Neurodiverse Tech Teams
status: Accept (Confirmed)
abstract: 'Psychological safety is the belief that a context is safe for interpersonal
  risk taking - that speaking up with ideas, questions, concerns, or mistakes will
  be welcomed and valued. Psychological safety is crucial in software engineering
  communication, particularly in tightly coupled team activities such as mob programming
  (i.e., mobbing), where three or more team members collaborate to develop software
  together. Autistic software engineers can feel unsafe in teams due to the anxiety
  and stress when communicating with others with different communication styles. A
  collaborative space that allows autistic team members to communicate in neurodiverse
  teams flexibly can increase the psychological safety and accessibility of collaborative
  software development. To identify tools and practices that foster psychological
  safety in neurodiverse collaborative mob programming, I will conduct a series of
  mixed-method, design-based studies. First, I conduct a survey and interview study
  to uncover the relationship between neurodivergent cognitive and communication traits
  and psychological safety in teams. Second, I generate design principles for psychological
  safety through the iterative design and evaluation of a neuroinclusive digital collaboration
  space. Third, I evaluate the impact of these design principles through an experiment
  with minority, majority, and all neurodivergent teams. My work makes the following
  contributions to accessible software engineering education and practice: 1) Novel
  descriptions of psychological safety relating to neurodivergent cognitive and communication
  attributes; 2) design principles for fostering psychological safety in collaborative
  software development teams; 3) a software development tool that scaffolds psychologically
  safe mobbing in neurodiverse software teams.'
academic_interests: Hi, Iâ€™m Ren. Have you ever felt good about sharing an idea with
  a group? Thatâ€™s psychological safety. Iâ€™m a PhD Student researching psychological
  safety in neurodiverse tech teams. Tech work is more than programming. Tech reflecting
  and collaborating, which involves interpersonal risk â€“ especially when the way
  you think and behave diverges from socially constructed norms. I design practices
  and AI agents that help team members value each otherâ€™s ideas, questions, concerns,
  and mistakes. I hope to empower teams to create technology that respects neurodivergence
  and intersecting identities.
motivation: I value community. I would benefit immensely from building connections
  and knowledge with other students, researchers, and practitioners who value the
  experiences of software engineers and end users, and wish to cultivate more usable
  software. In the short term, I intend to conduct studies where I design social technologies
  with neurodiverse engineers and technologies in universities and industry teams.
  Long term, I hope to continue in a role where I research or manage software engineering
  teams to develop practices and software that enhance team safety and software quality.
  I am excited to discuss what I've learned, my plans, and the questions I have from
  sessions with my affinity group. I am also going on the market for internships for
  next summer, and the conference would be an excellent networking opportunity.
