topics: Computer Science (i.e., architectures, compilers/languages, networks, workflow/edge,
  experiment automation, containers, neuromorphic computing, programming models, operating
  systems, sustainable software); High-Performance Computing; Machine Learning and
  AI
abstract: In the performance and algorithms group, we tackle various applications
  and workflow performance optimization problems, using refactoring techniques of
  these codes to leverage DOE supercomputing machines efficiently. We aim to enable
  the development of cutting-edge solutions to tackle computationally challenging
  problems. Our SRP visitors are expected to engage in ongoing research efforts within
  our group to engage in an experience in developing performance modeling and tuning
  methods. We also encourage application developers with performance challenges to
  engage with us to apply our developed methods in improving the performance of their
  code in leading DOE computational environments. We also encourage application developers
