name: Anna Giannakou
organization: Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
title: Informing the next generation of HPC networking using intelligent data analytics
topics: Computer Science (i.e., architectures, compilers/languages, networks, workflow/edge,
  experiment automation, containers, neuromorphic computing, programming models, operating
  systems, sustainable software); Data Science (i.e., data analytics, data management
  &amp; storage systems, visualization); High-Performance Computing; Machine Learning
  and AI
abstract: Scientific discovery depends on analyzing large amounts of experimental
  data that are produced from different instruments scattered around the world. In
  the next 10 years the amount of experimental data produced is expected to increase
  by at least two orders of magnitude. In order to be analyzed, data needs to be transferred
  fast and reliably to HPC centers introducing network performance as a critical factor
  for success. In this project we will use data analysis combined with machine learning
  to detect data movement performance patterns that will inform the design of dynamic
  HPC networks. We will use scientific network traffic from NERSC, one of the leading
  HPC facilities in the world. In this project we are looking for someone to help
  us understand information from different sources and ultimately unveil the key to
  faster, next generation HPC networks.
