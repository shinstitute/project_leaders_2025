organization: Oak Ridge National Laboratory
title: Challenges/Opportunities for the Extreme Heterogeneity and HPC-AI era
topics: Computer Science (i.e., architectures, compilers/languages, networks, workflow/edge,
  experiment automation, containers, neuromorphic computing, programming models, operating
  systems, sustainable software); High-Performance Computing
abstract: 'This project is aimed at the implementation, evaluation and optimization
  of novel performance portable and heterogeneous programming solutions for the upcoming
  extreme heterogeneity era in computing. The project includes the design of novel
  software solutions on the available software and hardware platforms. Learning objectives
  for the applicant include: i) develop HPC codes based on performance portable programming
  models, such as OpenMP/OpenACC, C++, Kokkos, Julia, task-based runtimes, on current
  HPC and heterogeneous (CPU+GPU) architectures, ii) acquire skills in both, software
  solutions and HPC codes implementation, iii) gain experience in performance analysis
  on HPC architectures.'
