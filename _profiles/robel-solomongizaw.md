organization: Minnesota State University
department: Computer Science
status: Accept (Confirmed)
academic_interests: "Curiosity about how data explains real-world patterns drives
  my academic path. One project Iâ€™m working on with my father studies Ethiopiaâ€™s
  import data. By building predictive models, weâ€™re exploring how trade trends can
  be understood and even forecasted, which connects my love of computer science with
  broader global challenges. I am currently working with the Better Business Bureau
  on a computer science program focused on business data. This role involves matching
  and cleaning records from different sources, which has shown me how important accuracy
  and trust are in data systems. It has also strengthened my interest in creating
  reliable tools that organizations can depend on. Building side projects is another
  way I explore ideas. â€œParty Jam,â€\x9D an app that lets groups upvote songs to
  play, grew from my passion for both music and technology. Iâ€™m also developing
  a chatbot for Marriottâ€™s FOSSE system, which uses natural language processing
  to make training resources easier to access. Moving forward, my goal is to keep
  blending computer science, data analysis, and AI to design tools that are practical,
  accessible, and meaningful for everyday users as well as for larger communities."
motivation: My dad, who is a researcher, always told me that real learning happens
  when you work with others. He shared stories about the mentors who helped him, and
  that taught me the value of staying humble and open to guidance. I see the US-RSE25
  Building Engagement program as a chance to do the same for myself. I want to be
  part of this program because it gives me a place to learn from people who have more
  experience and to grow in how I think and communicate. Even though I have learned
  a lot about computer science, I know I can get better at sharing my ideas and working
  with others. Being around people who are passionate about research software will
  push me to improve and give me the confidence to bring new ideas forward.
