academic_interests: My research interests encompass high-performance and parallel
  computing with applications to deep learning and scientific computing. I focus on
  optimizing collective communication protocols (MPI, NCCL), tensor computation for
  neural operators; alternatives to data parallelism and their performance analysis;
  and the design of scalable parallel frameworks for scientific applications. A particular
  area of my work is developing mathematically principled collective communication
  schemes to support scalable neural operators and machine-learning workloads. I primarily
  center my research focus in computer science, but I an inspired by problems that
  arise in computational science. I aim to leverage computing in mathematics and physics,
  and to build software that makes cross-disciplinary research faster, more reliable,
  and reproducible.
motivation: I am strongly interested in attending the USRSE'25 Building Engagement
  program because it directly supports my current work. My goal is to turn single
  use research code into reliable, sustainable, and reproducible tools that the broader
  research community can use. This yearâ€™s theme, Code, Practices, and People, maps
  directly to what I do. I like to build more robust and reliable systems for scientific
  research. In particular I focus on MPI+X and GPU performance, testing and continuous
  integration, packaging, and documentation. I believe I can learn community vetted
  practices and bring them back to my team. At USRSE'25 I want to meet both experienced
  and emerging research software engineers, hear how they entered the field, and understand
  what motivates them to write reliable and scalable software for science. I plan
  to ask practical questions about profiling distributed machine learning and simulation
  codes, improving contribution guidelines, and setting up simple templates that help
  new researchers succeed in using computational resources. The Building Engagement
  structure is ideal for me. It provides full access to the conference, mentoring,
  and guided networking that combine support with accountability. That will help me
  deepen my skills and connect with peers across universities and national laboratories.
  Finally, the programâ€™s emphasis on inclusion and community matches how I try to
  work now and how I want to lead next.

## Academic Interests

My research interests encompass high-performance and parallel computing with applications to deep learning and scientific computing. I focus on optimizing collective communication protocols (MPI, NCCL), tensor computation for neural operators; alternatives to data parallelism and their performance analysis; and the design of scalable parallel frameworks for scientific applications. A particular area of my work is developing mathematically principled collective communication schemes to support scalable neural operators and machine-learning workloads. I primarily center my research focus in computer science, but I an inspired by problems that arise in computational science.

## Motivation

I am strongly interested in attending the USRSE'25 Building Engagement program because it directly supports my current work. My goal is to turn single use research code into reliable, sustainable, and reproducible tools that the broader research community can use.
