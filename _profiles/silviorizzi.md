name: Silvio Rizzi
organization: Argonne National Laboratory
title: Enabling Scientific Discovery With Supercomputers
topics: Computer Science (i.e., architectures, compilers/languages, networks, workflow/edge,
  experiment automation, containers, neuromorphic computing, programming models, operating
  systems, sustainable software); Data Science (i.e., data analytics, data management
  &amp; storage systems, visualization)
abstract: As the first exascale supercomputers come online, scientists are confronted
  with formidable challenges in analyzing the outcomes of large-scale numerical simulations.
  I am actively seeking enthusiastic students and faculty members who share a deep
  interest in exploring the intricacies of supercomputer simulations. Together, we
  will leverage leading-edge technologies for scientific visualization and analysis
  to facilitate scientific discoveries.
