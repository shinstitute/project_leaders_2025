biography: Dr. Shu Hu is an assistant professor in the School of Applied and Creative
  Computing and the Director of the Purdue Machine Learning and Media Forensics (M2)
  Lab at Purdue University. He was a Post-Doctoral Fellow at the Heinz College of
  Carnegie Mellon University from 2022 to 2023. He received my Ph.D. degree in Computer
  Science and Engineering from the University at Buffalo, SUNY in 2022. He is the
  recipient of the National AI Research Resource (NAIRR) Pilot award (2024), the National
  Science Foundation CRII Award (2024), the Machine Intelligence Research Outstanding
  Reviewer Award (2023), and SUNY Buffalo's CSE Best PhD Dissertation Award (2022).
  His research interests include machine learning, media forensics, and computer vision.

abstract: DeepFake, a term increasingly mentioned in the news and social media, refers
  to highly realistic fake images, and videos created using AI algorithms. Combating
  DeepFake technology requires a comprehensive strategy that extends well beyond the
  realm of mere detection, emphasizing the responsible design, development, and deployment
  of technologies. This also known as responsible forensics, focuses on applying forensic
  science to digital content ethically, ensuring that actions to identify and mitigate
  DeepFakes meet high ethical standards and respect for human rights. At the heart
  of responsible forensics lies the commitment to fairness, especially important in
  the context of generative AI. It is crucial for detection tools to be crafted and
  used in ways that prevent unintentional bias against certain individuals or groups,
  thus upholding justice and equality in the digital realm. Therefore, our goal is
  to improve fairness in detecting novel DeepFakes.
desired_skills: Python Programming Skill.
