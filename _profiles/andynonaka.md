title: Multiphysics and Multiscale Modeling with AMReX
topics: Computational Science Applications (i.e., bioscience, cosmology, chemistry,
  environmental science, nanotechnology, climate, etc.); High-Performance Computing;
  Machine Learning and AI
abstract: The Center for Computational Sciences (CCSE) and Engineering at LBL is home
  to applied mathematicians, computer scientists, and domain scientists that perform
  modeling and simulation of complex PDE systems across a variety applications. We
  are seeking collaboration with scientists interested in working on existing CCSE
  projects and/or developing their models and algorithms using the AMReX framework,
  an exascale ready infrastructure that supports structured grid, particle/particle-mesh,
  and machine learning algorithms. Active applications in CCSE include astrophysics,
  cosmology, multiphase flow, accelerators, plasma physics, microelectronics, atmospheric
  flows, oceanic flows, microscale flow, and stochastic mesoscale systems.
