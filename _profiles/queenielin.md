academic_interests: I've always admired the beauty of problem-solvingâ€”specifically,
  the logic in analyzing the challenges and the positive impact the solution has on
  those affected by the issue. Computer science became my favorite method for problem-solving
  when I discovered it in high school. As a first-generation low-income student, I
  was motivated to take AP Computer Science A through a scholarship given to high
  scorers on the exam. Upon learning the basics of Java, I developed a GUI interface
  for my familyâ€™s restaurant, which served as a reference for our point-of-sale
  system and helped servers become familiar with the dine-in layout. When I heard
  students complaining about how waiting for their lunch takes up more than half the
  lunch period, I created an app that made the lunch handout system more efficient.
  After my first year at Swarthmore College, I knew I was broadly interested in how
  computational methods can be applied to large-scale societal challenges, but I wasn't
  sure where to start. I spent this summer attending student programs such as ACCESS
  STEP 1 and PEARC25, which gave me exposure to areas of computer science such as
  high-performance computing, cyberinfrastructure, machine learning, and more. These
  experiences, in addition to my internship with a Congressional office this summer,
  gave me insight into technical research and how it impacts policy and real-world
  decision-making (and vice versa). Ultimately, my academic and research interests
  lie at the intersection of computing, economics, and social good, and I would appreciate
  any opportunity to develop my technical skills.
motivation: My experiences at STEP and PEARC25 introduced me to HPC and RSE, but they
  also made me aware of how much I still have to learn. While participating in the
  PEARC25 Student Program this summer, I was matched with my mentor, Kyriakos (Kai)
  Tsoukalas. After learning about my interest in exploring different pathways in research
  computing, he recommended that I apply to become a funded participant at US-RSE
  2025. I was instantly drawn to the conference because of its emphasis on community.
  Attending US-RSE25 would allow me to see how professionals collaborate on real-world
  challenges of reproducibility, usability, and security, as well as give me the opportunity
  to connect with mentors and peers who are building the future of this field. As
  someone still early in their career, I value the opportunity to learn in small groups
  and hear diverse perspectives on where RSE is heading. My background at the intersection
  of computer science, economics, and policy will allow me to bring a unique lens
  to these conversations, and I am excited to both learn from and contribute to the
  community.
