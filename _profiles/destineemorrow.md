abstract: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) affects 24% of all Veterans or 1 in every
  15 Americans and is associated with increased risk for developing cardiovascular
  and metabolic comorbidities such as heart disease, stroke, hypertension, and type
  2 diabetes mellitus. A vast number of patients are already experiencing at least
  one of these comorbidities by the time they are diagnosed with OSA; suggesting that
  OSA is being diagnosed well after the onset. OSA shares many symptoms with other
  diagnoses such as depression, increasing the diagnosis gap. With the use of machine
  learning and natural language processing, we can better understand and identify
  OSA and target patients for treatment closer to the onset, reducing the likelihood
  of patients developing comorbidities.
