project_title: Building Trustworthy Scientific Foundational Model
nairr_project: Scientific Foundational Model Development for Supporting Trustworthy
  Scholarly Writing
topical_areas: Artificial Intelligence and Intelligent Systems
abstract: 'Scholarly writing is a complex cognitive task requiring continuous decision-making,
  extensive working memory, and multitasking. Developing effective scholarly writing
  assistants is challenging due to the issue of non-factual responses from large language
  models (LLMs) and isolated assistance at different stages of writing. Our project
  aims to develop scientific foundational models that provide reliable, multimodal
  support for the entire writing process, including text, images, code, social media
  discussions, and peer reviews. We will enhance trust by marking original reference
  sources in generated content and linking references across modalities. Upon completion,
  we will release two open-source models: a pretrained LLM identifying reference sources
  in outputs, and a fine-tuned VLM for vision-language tasks. All data, model weights,
  and training details will be openly shared to promote scientific transparency. These
  models are expected to enhance scientific discovery and contribute to the development
  of reliable, safe AI across various fields.'
desired_skills: Ideal participants should have skills in machine learning and NLP,
  including experience with large language models (LLMs), and Python-based development.
  They should understand scholarly writing processes, reference management, and data
  curation for text, images, and code. Strong interests in open science, and creating
  trustworthy systems are essential. Collaborative abilities, clear communication,
  and a willingness to learn and mentor are also important.
