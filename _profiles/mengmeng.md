  environmental science, nanotechnology, climate, etc.); High-Performance Computing
abstract: My expertise covers advanced multi-physics geomechanics testing, well integrity,
  cement materials, poromechanical modeling, and data analysis. With these skills,
  I have participated in many different projects, including well integrity and stability
  for geothermal and CCUS, wellbore and reservoir stimulation for geothermal and unconventional,
  injection induced seismicity for geothermal and carbon sequestration, and data analysis
  for CCUS. I believe there are still lots of opportunities for Petroleum Engineering
  with application to the energy transition.
