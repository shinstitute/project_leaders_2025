title: Global Climate Modeling
topics: Computational Science Applications (i.e., bioscience, cosmology, chemistry,
  environmental science, nanotechnology, climate, etc.); High-Performance Computing
abstract: My group is part of a multi-lab collaboration to develop a global climate
  model that runs well on DOE's most advanced computing facilities. We are involved
  in all aspects of the software development of the model and its performance on heterogeneous
  architectures. We also develop python tools for analyzing the data. Join our group
  if you are interested in any of these topics.
