title: Effective Data Management for Large Scientific Workflows
topics: Data Science (i.e., data analytics, data management &amp; storage systems,
  visualization); Machine Learning and AI
abstract: The Scientific Data Management (SDM) research group is broadly interested
  in enabling and accelerating scientific discoveries through effective data management
  and analysis tools and libraries. The SDM groupâ€™s research and development efforts
  focus on (1) scalable storage and I/O strategies, (2) autonomous data management
  infrastructure, (3) data life-cycle management, and (4) workflow optimization and
  automation. Our group actively works with data generation and analysis workflows
  to reduce the complexity of large scientific analyses, including complex real-time
  workflows that could drive the next generation of scientific user facilities. Members
  of the SDM group work closely with application scientists throughout the DOE community,
  academic and industry researchers around the world. The group has a strong history
  of publications and contributes to many widely used software systems. We have strong
  contributions to well-known I/O libraries including HDF5 and ADIOS; and are the
  primary developers of FastBit, FasTensor, and so on.
