organization: Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
title: Using AI and HPC for Healthcare and Precision Medicine
topics: Computational Science Applications (i.e., bioscience, cosmology, chemistry,
  environmental science, nanotechnology, climate, etc.); Data Science (i.e., data
  analytics, data management &amp; storage systems, visualization); Machine Learning
  and AI
abstract: As part of our collaboration with the VA and DOE, we are currently using
  natural language processing to extract important life events from electronic health
  records that are correlated with high suicide risk. In this project, we are looking
  for a student intern that is interested in the cross-section of machine learning
  and healthcare that can help us develop a user-friendly interface for clinicians
  and researchers. Ideally, this UI will help accelerate better decision-making.
