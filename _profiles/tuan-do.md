biography: Tuan Do is an Associate Professor at UCLA in the Physics and Astronomy
  Department. He is the PI of the UCLA Astrophysics Data Lab. He got his undergraduate
  degrees in Physics and Astrophysics from UC Berkeley and his Astrophysics Ph.D.
  at UCLA. His research focuses on translating ML/AI models for Astrophysics applications.
  He created the first Machine Learning for Physical Science course at UCLA.

abstract: This project is to study how to use large language models (LLMs) and related
  technologies into a course on Machine Learning for Physical Sciences at the upper
  division undergraduate level. LLMs are now a prominent technology in computer science
  and the industry, and many students have experience using them. However, students
  do not typically get the opportunity to setup their own LLM and do experiments on
  them. Specifically, the use of LLMs in scientific education is not well explored.
  This project aims to develop a course unit on both using existing LLMs as well as
  the underlying LLM architectures (e.g. transformers) for science. Potential projects
  include setting up and deploying local LLMs and examining their abilities to do
  physics research. Another is to combine images and text from astrophysics into a
  transformer to use data fusion for classification. By giving students experience
  in underlying technologies behind these tools, they will become more knowledgeable
  and responsible users of AI and develop skills useful for their careers.
desired_skills: Background in teaching, designing lab courses, and/or deploying large
  language models.
