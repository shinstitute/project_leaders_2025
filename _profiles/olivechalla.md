status: Accept (Confirmed)
academic_interests: As a Computer Science undergraduate, I am deeply interested in
  the fields of Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning and Cybersecurity. I see
  AI as a transformative force in technology, and Iâ€™m particularly curious about
  how it can be developed sustainably and ethicallyâ€”enhancing human capabilities
  rather than replacing them. Additionally, I am eager to explore the intersection
  between AI and Cybersecurity. As technology continues to advance, I believe strong
  security measures are essential to maintaining trust and stability, making it a
  critical area of study alongside AI.
motivation: am eager to attend the US-RSE25 conference because it aligns closely with
  both my professional goals and my values as an emerging computer scientist. As someone
  preparing to pursue graduate studies and a career in cybersecurity, I believe engaging
  with the Research Software Engineering (RSE) community will allow me to expand my
  technical knowledge while also building meaningful professional connections. I am
  particularly drawn to the programâ€™s emphasis on Community and Resources. The opportunity
  to learn from experienced RSEs, share knowledge, and gain access to career development
  resources will be invaluable as I transition into advanced study and professional
  practice. I also deeply value the programâ€™s commitment to Advocacy and Diversity,
  Equity, and Inclusion (DEI). These principles resonate with my belief that diverse,
  inclusive, and well-supported communities foster innovation and strengthen the impact
  of research and technology. By participating, I hope to both learn from and contribute
  to this community, gaining insights that will guide my academic path and professional
  growth in the years ahead.
