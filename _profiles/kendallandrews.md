name: Kendall Andrews
organization: Michigan State University
department: Statistics and Probability
status: Accept (Confirmed)
academic_interests: My academic research interests focus on integrating advanced analytical
  methods from computer and data science with my creative background in the artsâ€”particularly
  danceâ€”to drive innovation in sports analytics. I am passionate about leveraging
  artificial intelligence to analyze and classify human movement, with the vision
  of enhancing performance technology in sports and eventually applying these advancements
  to dance. Currently, I am working with a sport science professor and a Ph.D. student
  on a project with Michigan State University's volleyball team, where we use accelerometer
  data and techniques such as Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), Support Vector Machines
  (SVM), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and XGBoost to classify player movements
  with a 95% accuracy rate. For my capstone, I plan to extend this work by developing
  a dance-specific classification model, combining movement science and machine learning
  to explore new applications in the performing arts.
motivation: I am interested in attending the US-RSE25 conference because I want to
  build on the incredible experience I had at SIAM MDS24, where I learned advanced
  concepts in math and data science, and connected with inspiring professionals and
  peers. Before entering the tech industry, I want another opportunity to grow as
  a student, explore areas of research software engineering, and discover opportunities
  I may not even know exist. US-RSE25 offers exposure to cutting-edge innovations,
  hands-on sessions, and insights from leaders in software engineering and technology.
  I am particularly interested in learning how my skills and interests intersect with
  software engineering as I transition from a computer science background in undergrad
  to a data science focus in graduate school. Equally important, I look forward to
  connecting with professionals and mentors who share similar passions. Building these
  relationships will inspire me, help refine my goals, and guide me toward a career
  path that is both technically strong and creatively fulfilling.
