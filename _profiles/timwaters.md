title: Radiation-MHD modeling of accreting black holes
topics: Computational Science Applications (i.e., bioscience, cosmology, chemistry,
  environmental science, nanotechnology, climate, etc.); High-Performance Computing
abstract: I am interested in pursuing collaborations to work on topics in radiation-MHD
  modeling for black hole astrophysics. Specific projects include deriving dispersion
  relations for the linearized radiation-MHD equations, calculating the observables
  obtainable from reverberation mapping campaigns, modeling outflows in low-mass X-ray
  binaries, and modeling accretion flows around supermassive black holes. These projects
  range from semi-analytic, requiring only knowledge of basic complex function theory
  and python programming, to fully numerical, requiring knowledge of C++ and high-performance
  computing.
