abstract: This project aims to harness cutting-edge large language models (LLMs) to
  enhance real-time monitoring, anomaly detection, and predictive maintenance in a
  thermal-fluid facility designed for advanced nuclear reactors. By integrating sensor
  data, experimental logs, and domain-specific knowledge, the LLM-based platform will
  identify off-normal events and potential cybersecurity threats, providing timely
  diagnostics to operators. The resulting methods and tools will be published openly,
  enabling broader adoption within the nuclear industry and fostering safer, more
  efficient reactor operations.
