name: Patricia Gonzalez-Guerrero
organization: Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
title: Beyond moore computer architectures
topics: Computational Science Applications (i.e., bioscience, cosmology, chemistry,
  environmental science, nanotechnology, climate, etc.); Computer Science (i.e., architectures,
  compilers/languages, networks, workflow/edge, experiment automation, containers,
  neuromorphic computing, programming models, operating systems, sustainable software);
  High-Performance Computing; Machine Learning and AI
abstract: 'Project 1: FPGA based architecture exploration. We use FPGAs to evaluate
  architectural features that could improve performance in scientific computing. We
  then can take the FPGA tested architecture and generate ASICs. Project2: We propose
  to explore temporal computing, stochastic computing, or deterministic streams for
  more efficient computing. Project3: We propose to explore superconducting computing
  for low power high performance computing.'
