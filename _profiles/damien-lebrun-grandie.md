biography: Damien Lebrun-Grandié is a Senior Computational Scientist at Oak Ridge
  National Laboratory with over a decade of experience in the field. He holds a PhD
  in Nuclear Engineering from Texas A&M University, a MSc in Physics from the Karlsruhe
  Institute of Technology in Germany, and a MEng in Physics Engineering from Grenoble
  INP in France. His research focuses on developing algorithms and enabling technologies
  for solving large-scale, complex engineering, and scientific problems. As a founding
  member of the High Performance Software Foundation, Damien was instrumental in getting
  the organization started and continues to play a leading role on the Governing Board,
  representing the Technical Advisory Council. He is also the co-lead of the Kokkos
  C++ performance portability project, where he oversees a large international team
  of developers and researchers. Additionally, he represents ORNL on the C++ Standards
  Committee, where he has been a key contributor to foundational features for scientific
  computing like std::mdspan in C++23 and std::linalg for C++26.

topical_areas: Applied Computer Science; High Performance Computing; Performance Evaluation
  and Benchmarking; Software Engineering
abstract: 'This internship focuses on developing Kokkos Tools, a vital suite of libraries
  for analyzing and optimizing Kokkos applications without changing the source code.
  You will help expand the Kokkos Tools ecosystem by building: Performance & Energy
  Profiling tools to measure execution time, memory usage, and energy consumption.
  This work helps developers identify bottlenecks and optimize code for diverse hardware,
  including CPUs and GPUs. Code Sanity & Debugging tools to detect and diagnose common
  programming errors and invalid usage of the Kokkos API, ensuring code correctness.
  You will contribute to a major open-source project used globally in High-Performance
  Computing (HPC). You''ll gain hands-on experience in parallel programming, performance-portability,
  and the full software development lifecycle. This is a chance to build critical
  skills in performance analysis and debugging while connecting with the international
  HPC community.'
desired_skills: 'We''re looking for candidates with a passion for High-Performance
  Computing (HPC) and parallel programming. Relevant backgrounds could include Computer
  Science, Engineering, or a related technical field. Ideal interests and skills include:
  Experience with C++ (or a similar high-performance language). Familiarity with parallel
  programming models (e.g., CUDA, OpenMP, MPI, or Kokkos). An interest in performance
  analysis and finding ways to optimize code. A desire to contribute to a large-scale
  open-source project.'
