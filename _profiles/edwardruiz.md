abstract: Larger-than-memory data are being generated at increasing scale and frequency
  in many scientific fields today. This trend is especially evident in the life sciences,
  where there is also a plethora of file formats that are fragmented across disparate
  programming languages and libraries. The growing size and heterogeneity of such
  data pose a major bottleneck to scientific progress. As high-throughput sequencing
  and imaging technologies continue to advance and even outpace Mooreâ€™s law, it
  is crucial that more scalable, user-friendly, affordable, and interoperable computational
  methods are developed. To tackle this major challenge, we developed dbverse, an
  ecosystem of composable packages that are built on recent advances in embedded OLAP
  databases and a novel objectâ€“relational mapping framework. Dbverse enables scalable
  analysis of three general scientific data sources, including sparse and dense matrices
  (dbMatrix), spatial geometries (dbSpatial), and genomic sequence files (dbSequence).
  In this talk, we discuss the architecture and methods of dbverse libraries, showcase
  a real-world application to the emerging spatial omics field through the GiottoDB
  R package, and discuss our roadmap for future development. In addition, we report
  extensive benchmarks comparing how the runtime and memory usage of dbverse methods
  outperform those from established in-memory and on-disk methods. Dbverse adopts
  FAIR principles, is open source, and aims to democratize larger-than-memory scientific
  data analysis with databases.
academic_interests: Over the last ten years of my academic career, my research interests
  have centered on developing scalable computational methods and open-source software
  for various domains, including biology, medicine, and cybersecurity. My interests
  first formed during my undergraduate studies at UW-Madison, where I initiated a
  collaboration between Dr. Kevin Eliceiri (developer of ImageJ2/FIJI software) and
  Dr. Timothy J. Kamp (stem cell scientist). Through this formative experience, I
  learned firsthand how software can enable researchers to make new scientific discoveries.
  Shortly after graduating, as part of my masterâ€™s degree at Columbia University,
  I conducted similar interdisciplinary research projects in both bioengineering and
  computational biology labs. This experience further shaped my interest in scalable
  approaches to data analysis. It also guided my decision to pursue an internship
  as part of my GEM PhD Science Fellowship at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, where
  I learned to apply scalable machine learning approaches to large-scale (&gt;1 billion
  row) cybersecurity datasets. Now completing my Ph.D. at Boston University, my thesis
  focuses on the development of open-source software and scalable computational approaches
  for the analysis and visualization of large multimodal datasets, which are increasingly
  generated by rapid advances in next-generation sequencing technologies (e.g., spatial
  omics). My current research aims not just to solve technical challenges, but to
  build accessible software that is intuitive for non-technical researchers (e.g.,
  clinicians). In recognition of my research, I have received several competitive
  awards, such as the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative Essential Open Source Software award
  and the BU Hariri Institute Graduate Fellowship.
motivation: I am interested in attending the US-RSE25 conferenceâ€™s Building Engagement
  (BE) program because it offers a unique opportunity for me to participate in my
  first RSE-focused conference and learn from others in the affinity group and mentorship
  program. The BE programâ€™s focus on fostering a welcoming, innovative, and diverse
  professional society particularly resonated with me as it closely mirrors my own
  values and career goals. Throughout my academic career, I have prioritized outreach
  and mentorship for researchers from all backgrounds, so participating in the BE
  program aligns closely with my previous experiences and could help me learn more
  how to improve as a future mentor for others in the RSE field.
