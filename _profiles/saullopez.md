department: Computer Science
status: Accept (Confirmed)
academic_interests: My academic interests lie in the intersection of computer science,
  medicine and mental health. My interest particularly lies in how technology can
  be used to improve diagnostics, treatment and accessibility in healthcare. As technology
  becomes more advanced and new discoveries are made, I believe the potential to address
  challenges within the medical and mental health field will become greater as well.
  My research interests include learning how technology can improve detection of disorders
  and modeling personalized treatment plans for different individuals, especially
  those from underserved communities where resources may be difficult to access.
motivation: I am interested in attending the US-RSE25 conference because it aligns
  with my passion for the healthcare field and utilizing software engineering and
  computer science to make advances in this field. I look forward to learning not
  only how this has been achieved but also about the practical approaches and tools
  that have made this possible. As a first-generation student, the opportunity to
  meet like-minded individuals and potential mentors from different backgrounds will
  provide valuable insights to grow personally and professionally as I strive to make
  a meaningful impact in healthcare. Attending this conference will also help me understand
  the ethical and technical challenges and solutions faced by professionals within
  the field. This conference is a unique opportunity that will allow me to learn from
  experts who can provide me invaluable information within the field. As a proud first-generation
  student, I embrace opportunities to learn, grow and push past boundaries, especially
  in environments where diverse voices and inclusive perspectives are valued. This
  conference is an opportunity that can open the door to a purpose I am passionate
  about. It would provide me the guidance and support I need to turn my ideas into
  meaningful solutions. It would help me take the critical first step toward building
  technology that improves mental health care for everyone, especially those often
  left behind.
