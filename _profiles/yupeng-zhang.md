biography: Yupeng Zhang is currently with the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace
  Engineering at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). He received his
  Ph.D. in Materials Science and Engineering from Texas A&M University, specializing
  in solid mechanics, Bayesian statics, and materials characterization, followed by
  postdoctoral positions at Northwestern University, and the California Institute
  of Technology. Zhang is a member of the ASCE - EMI Machine Learning in Mechanics
  Committee and the recipient of NAIRR grant as a single PI, the Future Faculty Symposium
  Travel Award from the Society of Engineering Science in 2023, the Clearfield Materials
  Fellowship at Texas A&M University, and the Mitacs Globalink Research internship
  from Mitacs Canada. Zhang has mentored over ten graduate and undergraduate students
  and serves as a reviewer for such as Journal of Applied Mechanics (ASME), Journal
  of Engineering Mechanics (ASCE), Mechanics of Materials (Elsevier), European Journal
  of Mechanics / A Solids (Elsevier), Journal of Materials Research (Springer), Journal
  of Engineering Materials and Technology (ASME), Experimental Mechanics (Society
  for Experimental Mechanics, SEM), Physics of Fluids(AIP). His research interests
  include solid mechanics, materials characterization Bayesian statistics, inverse
  problems, and AI/machine learning, focusing on multiscale modeling of complex system,
  and thermo-magneto-mechanical couplings.

abstract: A big challenge in advancing AI methods that enable scientific discovery
  is to understand what kinds of data are necessary to obtain accurate and transferable
  surrogate models. We explored this question in the context of the history-dependent
  behavior of materials and structures. We introduced an iterative approach where
  we used a rich arbitrary class of trajectories to train an initial model. We then
  iteratively updated the class of trajectories with those that arise in large-scale
  simulation and used transfer learning to update the model. We showed that such an
  approach converges to a highly accurate surrogate, and one that is transferable.
  In our current NAIRR Pilot project, we are investigating how geometry influences
  iterative learning in multiscale modeling of history-dependent metamaterials. Through
  the Sustainable Research Pathways (SRP) Program, we aim to develop AI/ML-based digital
  twins of physical materials and structures under various boundary conditions. The
  digital twins will serve as fast and reliable surrogates for multiscale modeling,
  optimization, and inverse design. This research connects AI/ML with mechanics, materials,
  structures, and design. Participants will gain experience with machine learning,
  numerical simulation, with applications spanning mechanical civil, and materials
  engineering.
desired_skills: Participants with interests in artificial intelligence, machine learning,
  numerical modeling, or materials / structures / mechanics are encouraged to apply.
  A background in engineering, computer science, applied math, applied statistics,
  or related fields is helpful, but not required. Curiosity and enthusiasm are especially
  valuable.
