project_title: Spack at LLNL
hpsf_project: Spack
topical_areas: Applied Computer Science; Applied Mathematics; Artificial Intelligence
  and Intelligent Systems; Computer Science; High Performance Computing; Open Source
  Software; Software Engineering
abstract: Depending on experience and interest, we will develop a project dealing
  with the open source Spack package manager (https://github.com/spack/spack) or the
  Spack package ecosystem (https://github.com/spack/spack-packages). Spack has become
  the de-facto package management tool for High Performance Computing, an area where
  software complexity is constantly rising. Spack helps users build, install, and
  manage software on laptops, desktops, and supercomputers. With over 1,500 contributors
  and over 8,500 package recipes, Spak provides a valuable resource for HPC users
  around the world. Example projects would include new core features for Spack, including
  terminal UI improvements, performance improvements, or enhancements to Spack's solver
  or other capabilities. Projects could also focus on package recipe improvements,
  e.g. improvements to AI packages or GPU support, improvements to Spack's continuous
  integration system. We can tailor the project to the applicant's experience and
  interest. On this project, you’ll learn more about the core of Spack, how it builds
  software, and how large software ecosystems are sustained through community effort.
desired_skills: For core Spack projects, we expect experience with Python and some
  Linux systems programming. An ideal candidate will have at least some experience
  with building and installing software, especially with build systems like CMake
  and Autotools. Low-level systems experience, e.g. UNIX process control, file I/O,
  and performance profiling are a plus. Experience with performance optimization and
  with using package managers, Spack or otherwise, are a plus.
