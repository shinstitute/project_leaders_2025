abstract: One of the big challenges in finding new molecules that can better capture
  solar energy, to design molecular crystals that can better capture CO2 from the
  air, or materials that can convert heat into electricity is the very large search
  space of possibilities. We can accelerate this search with AI and machine learning
  methods that allow us to quickly determine if a molecule or material has the desired
  properties, and if it can be made, but this search can still take forever. We have
  been developing approaches for inverse design. Projects can involve the further
  development of our inverse design methods, or exploring our tools for real science
  questions. Quantum computing has received a lot of attention. We now have noisy
  quantum computers online on which we can do actual experiments. Our projects range
  from developing algorithms and simulation approaches that translate scientific problems
  we run on classical computers to problems that can be run on quantum computers...and
  we run them on quantum computers to get scientific results.
