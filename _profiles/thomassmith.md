abstract: 'Computational electromagnetics and plasma physics (CEMP) are two areas
  of computational science that combine classical physics with high performance computing
  (HPC) to solve important national level problems. CEMP is a frontier in computational
  science requiring a great deal of discovery. The push to deliver fusion energy is
  growing, and at the national laboratories, universities and private sector, CEMP
  is playing an increasingly important role and will continue to do so. The project
  is centered around several fundamental concerns in CEMP. The first concern relates
  to verification of existing CEMP codes and asks the question "Is the code correct?"
  We use various numerical analysis techniques to answer this question including:
  developing analytic model problems from classic solutions, and constructing surrogate
  models that bridge gaps between theory and CEMP codes. We then run the CEMP on HPC
  systems to establish code credibility. The second concern relates to validation
  of CEMP codes and asks the question "Is our model correct?" To answer this question,
  we run sub- and system level simulations using HPC and use available data to determine
  how our CEMP solutions match up and address any gaps found in our modeling.'
