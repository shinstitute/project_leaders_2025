title: Next Gen Communication APIs in HPC
topics: Computer Science (i.e., architectures, compilers/languages, networks, workflow/edge,
  experiment automation, containers, neuromorphic computing, programming models, operating
  systems, sustainable software); High-Performance Computing
abstract: Communication offloading to GPUs represents a hot topic in science and industry.
  While many algorithms could benefit from this capability in terms of performance
  and programmability, novel communication APIs are required that are more suitable
  for GPU execution. In this work we examine the current PGAS support for distributed
  parallel programming in Kokkos and evaluate that implementation in comparison to
  proposals coming from the MPI Forum as well as hardware manufactures such as NVIDIA.
  Using micro-benchmarks we showcase performance and programmability differences and
  conclude this work with recommendations on future communication APIs for scientific
  computing and HPC.
