title: Randomized solvers for tensor eigenvalue problems
topics: High-Performance Computing Quantum Computing and Information Science
abstract: Eigenvalue computations are at the core of simulations in many applications,
  including quantum physics, material science, and electronic structure computations.
  On the other hand, randomized algorithms are currently gaining more attention because
  of their potential for both reducing computational complexity and data movement
  on the emerging heterogeneous computing systems. Project ideas could include comparing
  and testing different randomization schemes, incorporating mixed-precision, improving
  (CPU/GPU) performance, etc. Current and near-term quantum computers, also known
  as noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers, are characterized by low qubit
  counts, short qubit decoherence times, and high gate error rates. On the other hand,
  rapid progress in both quantum hardware and software results in continuous simulation
  needs of novel/modified quantum algorithms. The QCLAB++ simulation software package,
  developed at LBNL, is an object-oriented and fully templated C++ package for creating
  and representing quantum circuits. QCLAB++ can be used for rapid prototyping and
  testing of quantum algorithms, and allows for fast algorithm development and discovery.
  Project ideas could include improving (CPU/GPU) performance, adding different noise
  models, and expanding the quantum algorithmsâ€™ base.
