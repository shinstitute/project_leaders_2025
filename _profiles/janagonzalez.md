status: Accept (Confirmed)
academic_interests: For my senior capstone project, I was able to design a PCB board
  where I had to determine which components would best be of use for my board's purpose;
  hydrophone signal acquisition. Classes that assisted in this project was my embedded
  systems course. From this, I realized I enjoyed finding in-depth purposes of each
  component. I would like to study either how to making components more efficient
  and more sustainable. In my research affiliate position at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory,
  I was able to research source codes and software packages that ultimately helped
  my mentor and I achieve the sustainability and ultimately saving time and nodes
  used in the supercomputer, the Perlmutter, to efficiently retrieve data. From this
  I am interested in learning more on how to optimize a system that is already intact
  to have better/less energy consumption.
motivation: I have now graduated college as an Electrical Engineer. I took a year
  break working a hospitality job in my home-town so that I can save money to move
  to San Diego post graduating to seek better opportunities for a job in my career,
  and/or start a masters program. I am a very curious person, and with that, I want
  to hear and learn more about intersections between electrical engineering, software
  engineering and applied mathematics. Truth be told, I am seeking more guidance as
  to what my next steps may look like. Perhaps, some inspiration by these presenters
  and roaming peers can help me find that direction. I'm also an avid networker. I
  would like to take advantage to network in an area that I have never been before;
  with professionals who have wisdom through their work and/or students that are creative
  masters at the beginning of their research journey.

additional_comments: I am excited to be considered to attend this event so that I
  can be inspired by peers who are passionate about their work. I am a big community
  builder so, I believe this event will help me in my career and my future path and
  make those connections that will last longer than this event.
