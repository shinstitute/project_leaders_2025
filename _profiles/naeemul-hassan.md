biography: Dr. Naeemul Hassan is an Associate Professor in the Philip Merrill College
  of Journalism at the University of Maryland, jointly appointed with the College
  of Information Studies (iSchool). His research lies at the intersection of computational
  journalism, data science, and artificial intelligence, focusing on combating misinformation
  and enhancing the transparency and efficiency of news production. Dr. Hassan’s work
  combines natural language processing, machine learning, and human-centered approaches
  to improve how information is produced, verified, and consumed.

abstract: This project investigates how large language models (LLMs) can help bridge
  the gap between scientific best practices and healthcare journalism. Research shows
  that news coverage of medical treatments often omits critical details such as harms,
  evidence quality, or alternatives leading to public misunderstanding and even harmful
  health decisions. While frameworks exist to assess the quality of healthcare news,
  they are labor-intensive and not scalable. Our project explores the potential of
  LLMs (e.g., GPT models, LLaMA) to automatically evaluate healthcare news articles
  against science-informed criteria, provide explainable feedback, and support journalists
  in improving reporting quality. We will test models on a curated dataset of 2,000
  expert-annotated healthcare articles and extend the evaluation to larger datasets.
desired_skills: The project blends computational journalism, natural language processing,
  and human-computer interaction to advance both AI explainability and its practical
  applications in healthcare communication. Relevant expertise- Interest in AI/LLMs,
  computational journalism, or healthcare communication Familiarity with Python, machine
  learning, or NLP libraries (e.g., Hugging Face, OpenAI API) Experience with data
  annotation, text analysis, or evaluation frameworks Curiosity about interdisciplinary
  research that combines computer science, journalism, and public health Strong analytical
  and communication skills, with an openness to learning across fields
