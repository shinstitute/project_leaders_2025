  Evaluation and Benchmarking
abstract: This project seeks to prototype a proof-of-concept next generation geospatial
  foundation model that integrate geospatial knowledge, physical processes, temporal
  dynamics, and human actions to support pressing energy, security, and environmental
  challenges. We will take inspiration from the NVIDIA Cosmos – a platform for training
  general purpose world foundation models for physical AI and seek to prototype world
  models to support GeoAI foundation models that are equipped with capturing dynamic
  states of the physical world.
