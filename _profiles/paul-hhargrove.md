name: Paul H. Hargrove
organization: Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
title: UPC++/GASNet for lightweight communication and global address space support
topics: Computer Science (i.e., architectures, compilers/languages, networks, workflow/edge,
  experiment automation, containers, neuromorphic computing, programming models, operating
  systems, sustainable software); High-Performance Computing
abstract: Scientists use supercomputers to tackle some of the most challenging problems,
  ranging from biomedical simulations of COVID-19 spread in human lungs, to performing
  metagenome assembly based on environmental samples as a way to study climate change.
  The UPC++ library is used in both of these applications. We seek application and
  library developers to partner with our team, which develops parallel programming
  models such as UPC++ and GASNet-EX. These enable computational scientists across
  a broad range of disciplines to write high-performing, maintainable, parallel software
  for large-scale systems. If you are writing a parallel scientific application in
  C++, we would be glad to explore with you whether UPC++ could help with some of
  the more challenging aspects of your problem. UPC++ excels at handling applications
  and libraries that have challenging load balancing issues and irregular communication
  patterns. If your parallel program currently runs only in shared memory and you
  are interested in scaling up to larger, distributed-memory systems, we can help
  determine a path toward scalable performance on larger systems using UPC++.
