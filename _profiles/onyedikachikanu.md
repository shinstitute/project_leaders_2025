abstract: 'Monolithic software architectures are being replaced by microservices-based
  software architectures, which are more modular and flexible in design. Monoliths
  have all their components packaged within a single artifact and are deployed together.
  Microservices, on the other hand, is structured as a collection of smaller, independently
  deployable components with each component having its own responsibility. Many businesses
  adopt a software architectural style based on success stories, without a clear understanding
  of its benefits and trade-offs. There is a need to quantify the performance of each
  architecture to establish a solid foundation for understanding when and how to implement
  a given architecture best. As software systems become more complex, understanding
  the trade-offs between architectural choices becomes critical for long-term success.
  Our study evaluates the performance, scalability, and resource efficiency of monolithic
  and microservices architectures under varying levels of load. The Spring Petclinic
  applications were tested using prepared test cases on the local computer of one
  of the authors. The results were collected and compared using the JMeter tool. The
  results showed that the monolith outperformed the microservices in most metrics:
  it handled more requests, achieved over 70% higher throughput at maximum load, and
  maintained lower latency. The microservices architecture had a 0% error rate at
  low concurrency levels; however, as the load increased, the error rate rose to 63%
  at 100 users due to service failures caused by limited memory and CPU resources.
  Additionally, microservices consumed significantly more CPU and memory due to inter-service
  communication. These findings show that microservices provide modularity and deployment
  independence, but they need strong infrastructure to scale reliably. On the other
  hand, monolithic architecture is still a better choice for applications that run
  in constrained environments or have predictable workloads because it uses fewer
  resources and is more stable.'
academic_interests: My academic and research interests are in distributed computing
  and the principles of building scalable software systems. My motivation for research
  lies in the difficulty of designing and developing systems that can manage large
  volumes of data and user traffic efficiently without overwhelming the system or
  affecting performance. Specifically, I am interested in investigating how to maintain
  consistency and manage concurrency control when data is replicated across multiple
  nodes in a distributed system, as well as the adoption of microservices architecture
  to make a system more scalable. I worked on a research project that compared monolithic
  and microservices architectures. I analyzed performance metrics such as latency
  and throughput under different load levels using Apache JMeter in order to determine
  the trade-offs between these architectural designs. I aim to contribute to research
  that improves modern cloud computing environments and builds robust systems that
  are highly scalable and can manage the complexity of modern data and user demands.
motivation: I am very interested in joining the Building Engagement program because
  the program aims to help students navigate academic and career paths, and I believe
  I would benefit immensely from it. I intend to learn from experienced leaders in
  the US-RSE community on how to build a welcoming and more innovative professional
  society. I expect that by participating, I will be able to enhance both my professional
  standing and also contribute to the growth and visibility of the Research Software
  Engineering field.
