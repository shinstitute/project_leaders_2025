biography: Dr. Kenneth Moreland is a senior research scientist at Oak Ridge National
  Laboratory. He received BS degrees in computer science and in electrical engineering
  from the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology in 1997. He received MS and
  Ph.D. degrees in computer science from the University of New Mexico in 2000 and
  2004, respectively. Dr. Moreland specializes in large-scale visualization and graphics
  and plays an active role in the development of several HPC products including Viskores,
  ParaView, VTK, IceT, and Catalyst. His current interests include the design and
  development of visualization algorithms and systems to run on multi-core, many-core,
  and future-generation computer hardware.
project_title: Advanced Scientific Visualization with Viskores
hpsf_project: Viskores
topical_areas: Computer Science; High Performance Computing; Open Source Software;
  Software Engineering; Visualization and Human-Computer Systems
abstract: This project involves the Viskores software library (https://github.com/Viskores/viskores).
  This library provides functionality to process data that, most often, is generated
  by physics simulations and provides visual representations to improve data understanding.
  The Viskores algorithm performs numerous types of computational geometry to extract
  visually meaning features from data such as contour surfaces from fields and tracing
  paths within flow. Viskores is also responsible for the rendering of such features
  using a variety of computer graphics techniques. The specifics of the project will
  be tailored to the intern’s interests and abilities. The primary needs of the project
  involve an expansion of Viskores rendering capabilities, optimization of Viskores
  algorithms, and improved Viskores documentation.
desired_skills: C++; Familiarity with entering commands in a command prompt (e.g,
  terminal, xterm, powershell, etc.)
