project_title: Accelerating GNN Inference for High-Speed Particle Track Reconstruction
status: Accept (Confirmed)
abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) process large, sparse, and irregular graph,
  making them useful for particle track reconstruction. This project uses GNNs with
  TrackML which is a particle tracking challenge with the goal of reconstructing the
  paths of particles that traveled through detectors, and doing so as fast as possible
  without sacrificing accuracy. The GNN input graphs are processed using float32,
  but it is possible to also use Automated Mixed Precision (AMP) or manually convert
  to different precisions.
academic_interests: My research interests mainly include learning more about computer
  and software engineering research, and all of the opportunities it can give me.
  My current research has focused on GNN's (graph neural networks) and helping to
  optimize them for our current problem with efficiency.
motivation: My mentor recently put this on my radar, and it piqued my interest. Many
  of the topics discussed are of interest to me and I am excited to potentially learn
  more about them.
