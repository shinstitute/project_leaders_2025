abstract: Partial differential equations are used across many scientific fields to
  describe physical phenomena. However, nonlinear PDEs can be difficult to understand
  analytically and also difficult to simulate numerically. In particular, numerical
  simulation methods suffer from the curse of dimensionality, meaning that the number
  of degrees of freedom increase exponentially with problem dimension. Quantum-inspired
  algorithms offer a way to systemically reduce the degrees of freedom, potentially
  allowing for (sub)exponential reduction in computational cost. These algorithms
  are gaining in popularity and have been used to solve Navier-Stokes and the Vlasov
  equation with surprising success. This project can take many directions, such as
  extending these methods to different PDEs or considering problems with complex geometries.
