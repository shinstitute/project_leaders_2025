abstract: Achieving nuclear fusion power on earth requires incredibly durable materials
  capable of housing a tiny sun. We can use quantum materials modeling to make predictions
  about the behavior of prospective fusion materials, without the need for experiments.
  However, quantum models are very computationally expensive. Machine learning allows
  us to bypass much of the expense and enable larger scale modeling with quantum accuracy.
  With these models we can study thermomechanical properties and/or plasma interactions
  in fusion materials. Now, we can design fusion materials at the nanoscale for better
  performance. Project ideas include classical modeling of the fusion material, quantum
  modeling for the machine learning training set, or optimizing the code to better
  find the machine learning hyper-parameters.
