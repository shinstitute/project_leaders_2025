name: M. Scot Swan
organization: Sandia National Laboratories
title: Data Analysis to Speed Up Supercomputers
topics: Computational Science Applications (i.e., bioscience, cosmology, chemistry,
  environmental science, nanotechnology, climate, etc.); Computer Science (i.e., architectures,
  compilers/languages, networks, workflow/edge, experiment automation, containers,
  neuromorphic computing, programming models, operating systems, sustainable software);
  Data Science (i.e., data analytics, data management &amp; storage systems, visualization);
  High-Performance Computing
abstract: Our work would fall under the HPC/Application Metrology umbrella ("metrology"
  is the study of measuring stuff). So we want to measure the performance of the supercomputer,
  the performance of the applications that run on them, and how the two interact.
  I am interested in finding someone to help me speed up our High Performance Computing
  (HPC) supercomputers. We know that there are bottlenecks in our simulations, like
  memory, CPU, network, or filesystem limitations. Often these bottlenecks are temporary,
  so they are hard to find or reproduce. We need someone to run applications on the
  supercomputers and then analyze the performance data to find performance anomalies
  and then try to find a cause for them. When we have data showing problems, we can
  pass that to the system administrators for them to address, speeding up the supercomputer
  so more simulations can be done faster.
