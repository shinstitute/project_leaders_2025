  experiment automation, containers, neuromorphic computing, programming models, operating
  systems, sustainable software); High-Performance Computing; Machine Learning and
  AI
abstract: Lead scientific simulations at extreme scale through the co-design of applications,
  algorithms, and architectures. Deliver solutions for multiple science, engineering,
  and security missions including the development of methods for large-scale high
  performance computing applications. Work on a wide array of scientific problems
  ranging from weapons research and algorithmic co-design to compiler technologies
  and machine learning that enable scientists to concentrate on science rather than
  programming. Develop scientific software frameworks that are performance portable
  for different HPC architectures. Implement high-performing versions for important
  applications at the lab. Profile CPU/GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) codes, identify
  bottlenecks, improve the performance of applications using optimization techniques.
  Investigate and prototype performance improvements along with verification of outputs.
  Run codes on LANLâ€™s cluster and/or non-LANL supercomputers. Write codes in Python,
  C/C++ and CUDA (language for programming GPUs) and/or HIP (language for AMD GPU
  architectures). Use profiling tools, applied machine learning techniques and code
  transformations to improve the performance of applications.
