title: ML-based compression for derivative computation
topics: Computer Science (i.e., architectures, compilers/languages, networks, workflow/edge,
  experiment automation, containers, neuromorphic computing, programming models, operating
  systems, sustainable software); Machine Learning and AI
abstract: Efficient computation of derivatives for both computational science and
  machine learning applications often relies on the so-called reverse mode of automatic
  differentiation (autodiff). Unfortunately, reverse-mode autodiff requires saving
  many intermediate states, which can lead to substantial memory or storage requirements.
  This project will investigate whether lossy compression techniques based on machine
  learning can be used to compress this data and reduce memory requirements while
  maintaining suitable levels of accuracy in the derivative computations.
