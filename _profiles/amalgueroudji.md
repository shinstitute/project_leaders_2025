title: Performance Analytics of Dask Workloads
topics: Computer Science (i.e., architectures, compilers/languages, networks, workflow/edge,
  experiment automation, containers, neuromorphic computing, programming models, operating
  systems, sustainable software); Data Science (i.e., data analytics, data management
  &amp; storage systems, visualization); High-Performance Computing
abstract: Dask is a task-based distributed Python framework with the unique feature
  of offering distributed versions of well-known libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and
  Scikit-learn. It has been utilized for high-performance data analytics within high-performance
  computing (HPC) workflows. While it boasts a strong performance record, it currently
  lacks an analysis of I/O performance, which is critical for HPC workloads. In this
  project, the selected student will utilize Darshan to extract and analyze I/O operations
  in Dask. The primary objectives are to gain an understanding of I/O performance
  and subsequently propose solutions for its improvement.
