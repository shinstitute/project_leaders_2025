biography: Looi works in mathematical analysis, evolutionary PDEs, and AI. A core
  part of his research in analysis and PDEs involves the study of inequalities, including
  functional and polynomial inequalities, which are intimately related to many areas
  of pure and applied mathematics. In the AI-math domain, his contributions include
  proving theorems on the controllability of self-attention in “What’s the Magic Word?”,
  leading the data team at Project Numina (winner of the 2024 AIMO Prize), and advancing
  Lean-4 formalization in PDEs. He is a founding scientific advisor to ScienceStack,
  a platform for interactive, machine-readable papers. His work aims to merge machine
  learning, formal methods, and math to build reliable and reproducible reasoning
  workflows in mathematics.

abstract: Our proposed work advances AI for Accelerating Science and Discovery, a
  core focus area of the NAIRR Pilot, by developing a specialized, AI-driven framework
  for discovering and proving mathematical inequalities. Inequalities are foundational
  tools across scientific and engineering domains, from verifying stability in partial
  differential equations to bounding error terms in applied mathematics and physics.
  By combining large language models, reinforcement learning (RL), and symbolic computation,
  we aim to automate and accelerate the process of finding new results in both classical
  and cutting-edge mathematical research. This will facilitate the proof of inequalities
  and has the potential to enable new discoveries in science and engineering where
  precise mathematical bounds are important.
