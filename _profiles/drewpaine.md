title: Understanding Scientific User Needs
topics: Computer Science (i.e., architectures, compilers/languages, networks, workflow/edge,
  experiment automation, containers, neuromorphic computing, programming models, operating
  systems, sustainable software); Data Science (i.e., data analytics, data management
  &amp; storage systems, visualization); High-Performance Computing
abstract: User Experience (UX) research &amp; design is the practice of investigating
  the real world needs of humans and designing solutions to improve their ability
  to use computational systems. UX work at LBNL investigates the needs of scientific
  users (e.g., Jupyter users at NERSC, scientists at the ALS) and designs software
  to enable them to more efficiently and effectively do their research. Conducting
  UX work provides teams with the opportunity to diversify their points of view and
  dig into the challenges their focal users face on a daily basis, building empathy
  and reframing the software production process. UX also impacts the sustainability
  of software by improving the likelihood that it will develop a user base who are
  vital to its continued existence.
