title: Exploring HPC+AI workflows in Julia
topics: Computer Science (i.e., architectures, compilers/languages, networks, workflow/edge,
  experiment automation, containers, neuromorphic computing, programming models, operating
  systems, sustainable software); High-Performance Computing
abstract: We plan to explore the use of the Julia programming language on constructing
  high-performance computing (HPC) and AI workflows. We look towards the advancement
  of HPC software by incorporating a unifying high-level and high-performance Julia
  language as a scientific layer. We will explore cases on Frontier and Summit (if
  available).
