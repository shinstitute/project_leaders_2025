title: Investigating and Optimizing Supercomputer Network Performance
topics: Computer Science (i.e., architectures, compilers/languages, networks, workflow/edge,
  experiment automation, containers, neuromorphic computing, programming models, operating
  systems, sustainable software); Data Science (i.e., data analytics, data management
  &amp; storage systems, visualization); High-Performance Computing; Machine Learning
  and AI
abstract: Supercomputers use the fastest network and storage technologies to help
  solve big problems in artificial intelligence (AI) and climate science among other
  fields. However, properly configuring supercomputers requires carefully tuning the
  hardware and software to meet the performance needs of the work to be done. Projects
  ideas include creating new software to measure performance on supercomputers, analyzing
  and optimizing the performance of climate science and AI applications, investigating
  and simulating new supercomputer designs, and improving discrete event simulations.
