title: Supercomputer User Ticket Modeling and Analysis for Improving Scientific Output
topics: Data Science (i.e., data analytics, data management &amp; storage systems,
  visualization); High-Performance Computing; Machine Learning and AI
abstract: At the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC), we
  cater to a user base exceeding 9,000 individuals, facilitating groundbreaking scientific
  endeavors on the 8th fastest supercomputer globally. As part of our support team,
  our primary mission is to assist scientists and researchers in using this powerful
  resource for a variety of scientific computation. Our responsibilities encompass
  troubleshooting application issues, optimizing performance, and maintaining the
  computing hardware and software environment. In order to do this, we would like
  to make data-informed decisions based on user behavior by analyzing support ticket
  content to identify and address user needs strategically. For this project, we would
  like to use our ticket text information to gain insight into user behavior, sentiments
  and needs regarding high performance computing. We are open to working with a variety
  of tools and techniques to meet this goal. This could include machine learning driven
  analysis techniques such as natural language processing and data clustering powered
  by our own supercomputer. Or it could involve simple statistical analysis techniques
  as these models can also be effective tools for aiding understanding. A successful
  project will produce data artifacts that help identify user trends or behaviors
  to guide decisions about user services.
