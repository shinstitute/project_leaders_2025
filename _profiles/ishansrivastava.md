  environmental science, nanotechnology, climate, etc.); High-Performance Computing;
  Machine Learning and AI
abstract: We are developing numerical algorithms and computational models to simulate
  the dynamics of particulate materials, complex fluids and multiphase flows. The
  proposed approach involves integrating a particle-scale representation such as the
  discrete element method (DEM), a coarse-grained representation such as particle-in-cell
  (PIC), and a continuum-scale PDE representation of these materials using the tools
  of adaptive mesh and algorithm refinement, and data-driven machine learning methods.
  The overarching goal will be a multiscale modeling framework that can simulate a
  wide variety of particulate materials and complex fluids, and is performant on manycore/GPU-based
  high performance computing (HPC) platforms. Another goal of this project is to conduct
  large-scale simulations of complex fluids and multiphase flows on HPC platforms
  in application spaces such as bioreactors and advanced manufacturing.
