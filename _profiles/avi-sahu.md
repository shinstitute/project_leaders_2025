biography: 'Avinash (“Avi”) Das Sahu, PhD is an assistant professor at UNM Comprehensive
  Cancer Center and Dept of Computer Science, where he leads th TumorAI lab (Tumorai.org).
  His group designs interpretable, clinician ready AI that links molecular signals
  to real world decisions in cancer care. The group builds AI “co pilots” across two
  fronts: (1) genomics, including Protein2Text and the forthcoming Mutation2Text to
  explain variants—especially VUS—with clear, rationale based text; and (2) medical
  imaging, where EndoPilot and the multi agent MED X framework support transparent,
  human in the loop analysis of endoscopic images for colorectal cancer. Guided by
  a simple aim—to “prevent the preventable and treat the treatable”— he collaborates
  closely with oncologists and geneticists to move these tools from algorithms to
  clinic ready prototypes. His work has been recognized with awards such as the OCRA
  CDRG (PI), NIH Pathway to Independence (K99/R00), and the Michelson Prize, following
  training at the University of Maryland/NHGRI and postdoctoral work at Dana Farber/Harvard
  and the Broad Institute. Beyond publishing in venues such as Cancer Discovery and
  Nature Communications, his lab emphasizes open science, inclusive mentoring, and
  deployment on high performance computing resources to broaden access to expert level
  decision.'

abstract: "Millions of people face deep uncertainty in their fight against cancer.
  Two major hurdles often stand in the way of clear answers. First, genetic testing
  frequently returns ambiguous results called \"variants of unknown significance\"
  (VUS), leaving nearly 40% of patients in an anxious \"diagnostic limbo\" without
  clear medical guidance. Second, a nationwide shortage of specialists means that
  interpreting crucial medical images, like endoscopies, can be slow and inconsistent,
  delaying life-saving diagnoses. \U0001FA7A Our lab is pioneering a solution by building
  AI \"co-pilots\" for medicine. We have already developed the core technology: powerful
  AI models that can translate complex genetic data (Protein2Text) and interpret endoscopic
  images (EndoPilot). This project will focus on the most exciting application of
  these powerful tools. We will create Mutation2Text to demystify VUS with clear,
  understandable rationales. Concurrently, we will build MED-X, a framework where
  a team of our AIs work together (AI agents) to help doctors spot signs of colorectal
  cancer with greater accuracy. This project will deliver a unified pipeline that
  empowers clinicians, provides clear answers to patients, and makes expert-level
  care accessible to all."
desired_skills: 'We are building a diverse team and welcome collaborators from all
  backgrounds. Whether you are a coder, biologist, future doctor, or creative problem-solver,
  there is a place for you. We seek faculty/students with interests in: Technology
  & Data Science: Help build and train cutting-edge AI models using skills like Python
  and machine learning. Biology & Health Sciences: Use your background in genetics
  or life sciences to guide our AI’s reasoning and ensure its insights are clinically
  useful. Human-Centered Thinking: Help us create trustworthy, explainable AI that
  doctors can confidently use to improve patient care.'
