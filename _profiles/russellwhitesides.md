organization: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
title: Future Clean Jet Fuels
topics: Computational Science Applications (i.e., bioscience, cosmology, chemistry,
  environmental science, nanotechnology, climate, etc.); Computer Science (i.e., architectures,
  compilers/languages, networks, workflow/edge, experiment automation, containers,
  neuromorphic computing, programming models, operating systems, sustainable software);
  High-Performance Computing
abstract: This project will explore impacts of sustainable aviation fuels on performance
  of combustion in jet engines. We will investigate fuel property effects on combustion
  metrics such as stability, efficiency, emissions. To capture the chemical kinetic
  effects of the fuel we will use detailed models and highly resolved grids, necessitating
  the use of high-performance computing platforms. The study can be focused on combustion
  physics, computational performance of the simulation software, or some mix of the
  two.
