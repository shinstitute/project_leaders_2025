abstract: The mental well-being of the elderly population is a growing concern. According
  to the World Health Organization, approximately $14\%$ of adults aged 60 and over
  experience mental disorders, and the issues are often compounded by loneliness and
  social isolation. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising solution by enabling
  meaningful, multi-turn dialogues. Leveraging the advanced natural language processing
  utility of LLMs, we aim to develop an AI chatbot specifically designed for seniors.
  Our research goal is to create an LLM-empowered dialog system that ensures engaging
  conversations for senior participants, thus supporting their cognitive functions
  and offering accessible interaction tools alongside traditional human interviews.
  It also underpins research for crucial applications such as detecting Mild Cognitive
  Impairment and intervening in the early stages of dementia.
desired_skills: Successfully led at least one project in a relevant domain or involving
  large language models (LLMs). + First-author experience in submitting research papers
  to leading ML/AI conferences. + Strong background in LLM-focused research programming
  and prompt engineering.
