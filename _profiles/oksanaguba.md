title: Improving vertical discretizations in atmospheric modeling
topics: Computational Science Applications (i.e., bioscience, cosmology, chemistry,
  environmental science, nanotechnology, climate, etc.); High-Performance Computing
abstract: Due to the specifics of the flow in atmospheric global circulation models,
  horizontal and vertical dimensions are discretised very differently. The atmospheric
  dynamical core in the climate model that we use is formulated for hybrid pressure-based
  vertical levels. There are a few research questions that are related to the vertical
  discretizations in our model. For example, while having more vertical levels is
  better for model's fidelity, their number is restricted by related computational
  cost. Therefore there is a question of how and where to place a limited number of
  vertical levels while increasing the model's fidelity and usability for applications.
  The project can be focused on a few relevant aspects, including developing numerical
  methods, evaluation of the model for climate applications, or uncertainty quantification.
