biography: I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Creighton University,
  where I have taught and mentored students in computer science, data science, and
  health informatics since joining in July 2020. My research focuses on developing
  advanced deep learning models for applications in computer vision, medical imaging,
  and natural language processing. Before my current role, I completed postdoctoral
  research in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Central Florida
  from September 2018 to June 2020, contributing to projects funded by the Defense
  Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), National Science Foundation (NSF), and
  Royal Bank of Canada (RBC), with a focus on deep learning and computer vision. Additionally,
  I conducted postdoctoral research in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering
  at the University of Alabama at Birmingham from July 2017 to August 2018, working
  on National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded projects related to deep learning
  and medical image processing. My research has obtained compute credits through NAIRR
  Pilot Classroom, NAIRR Startup, Amazon Web Services, and Google Cloud Platform.
  I have published articles in high-impact AI venues, including NeurIPS, CVPR, ECCV,
  and ICCV.
project_title: Building Generative AI Applications
nairr_project: CSC 590 - Building Generative AI Applications
topical_areas: Artificial Intelligence and Intelligent Systems; Computer Science;
  Health Sciences; Software Engineering
abstract: This project explores how to build artificial intelligence systems that
  can create, understand, and assist with real-world tasks. We'll work on three exciting
  types of applications. First, we'll create an AI that can generate new content,
  such as images. This has applications everywhere from art and entertainment to marketing
  and product design. Second, we'll build AI that can search through large collections
  of information and provide accurate, helpful answers by combining what it finds
  with its ability to generate responses. Think of this as creating smarter search
  tools or assistants that can actually comprehend documents and assist people in
  making informed decisions. Third, we'll develop autonomous AI agents that can complete
  multi-step tasks independently, like digital assistants that handle scheduling,
  research, or workflow automation. This work matters because these technologies are
  transforming every industry from healthcare to education to creative fields. Understanding
  how to build them responsibly puts you at the forefront of real innovation. We welcome
  collaborators from all backgrounds and experience levels, whether you're interested
  in coding, design, ethics, user experience, or simply curious about what AI can
  do. You'll gain practical hands-on skills while working on applications that could
  genuinely help people in their everyday lives.
desired_skills: We welcome collaborators from diverse backgrounds and with varying
  experience levels. Helpful skills include basic programming in any language, an
  interest in how AI systems work, or experience with data and information. Creative
  thinking, problem solving, user experience design, and perspectives on ethics or
  responsible AI development are all valuable. Most importantly, we're looking for
  curiosity, willingness to learn, and enthusiasm for exploring how these technologies
  can solve real problems.
comments: 'If possible, I would be interested in considering the following two students
  from Creighton University: (1) Our PhD student, Vignesh Rathinavelpandian Anandavel,
  applied for the student track and was also included in my initial faculty track
  application. (2) The undergraduate student, Sara Avila, was only included as a student
  in my initial faculty track application.'
