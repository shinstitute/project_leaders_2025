title: Computer architecture, system profiling, and networking
topics: Computer Science (i.e., architectures, compilers/languages, networks, workflow/edge,
  experiment automation, containers, neuromorphic computing, programming models, operating
  systems, sustainable software); High-Performance Computing
abstract: The umbrella of my research is high performance computing (supercomputers)
  as well as applications. The task broadly is to design the supercomputers for 10-20
  years from now. There are a few potential topics that look for adjacent skills.
  One possibility is research on computer architecture that uses knowledge of hardware
  description languages or FPGAs. Another possibility is networking (either on-chip
  or system-wide) research on new router architectures, flow control and such by the
  use of a simulator. Another possibility is profiling production systems by the use
  of perf or similar tools followed by analyzing and creating new metrics and plotting
  results in order to extract insights. Other related topics are also possible such
  as programming models, algorithms, and job scheduling. A combination of the above
  topics is also possible and encouraged. In addition, if faculty or students propose
  interesting and related topics that will also be great because it can lead to new
  areas of research.
