title: Accelerating Scientific Insights Through Advanced Data Exploration
topics: Computational Science Applications (i.e., bioscience, cosmology, chemistry,
  environmental science, nanotechnology, climate, etc.); Computer Science (i.e., architectures,
  compilers/languages, networks, workflow/edge, experiment automation, containers,
  neuromorphic computing, programming models, operating systems, sustainable software);
  High-Performance Computing
abstract: Large scale science simulations and observations both generate enormous
  data volumes that must be analyzed to generate scientific insights. Sometimes, this
  analysis are simple min/max to support visualization. Other times, they are complex
  or derived quantities. For example, an air pressure gradient can show both a hurricane
  as well as straight-line winds. Being able to query for places where the gradient
  meets criteria is more general and helpful when looking for severe weather events.
  This work will help support managing these derived quantities as well as supporting
  the query operations. No prior knowledge of the mathematical operations nor special
  machine learning or database skills required. Some exposure to ease on the job learning
  is desired.
