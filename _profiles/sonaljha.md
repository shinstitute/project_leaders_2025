project_title: Early Risk Assessment of Healthcare Conditions under Rural Data-Quality
  Constraints
status: Accept (Confirmed)
abstract: Early risk assessment of healthcare conditions becomes particularly challenging
  in rural and resource-limited settings, where access to dense, continuous, and high-frequency
  medical data is constrained. Similar challenges arise in crisis scenarios, such
  as natural disasters, where robust monitoring infrastructure is unavailable. Despite
  these limitations, timely and real-time alerts are critical for enabling proactive
  clinical interventions. To address this gap, we explore graph-based algorithms that
  effectively leverage sparse, irregularly recorded, and low-frequency data to provide
  reliable early risk assessment under rural data-quality constraints.
academic_interests: I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Engineering at Virginia Tech,
  where my research focuses on developing scalable graph-based anomaly detection algorithms
  for early and explainable disease detection in human and animal healthcare. This
  work lies at the intersection of graph analytics, machine learning, and high-performance
  computing (HPC), with a focus on methods that are both scientifically accurate and
  computationally efficient. Equally central to my academic path is my role as a Graduate
  Research Assistant with Virginia Techâ€™s Advanced Research Computing (ARC). In
  this position, I support university faculty, postdocs, and students in scaling and
  optimizing their workloads on ARCâ€™s HPC clusters. My work spans research consultation,
  data management, and technical support, including designing and debugging SLURM
  job scripts, tuning performance for parallel codes, managing large-scale data pipelines,
  and installing scientific software. Increasingly, I have also helped users integrate
  AI workflows within HPC environments. A consistent theme has been lowering technical
  barriers by building user-friendly workflows so that researchers can more effectively
  leverage HPC resources without being slowed by system complexities. I further expanded
  these skills during my internship at Los Alamos National Laboratory, where I integrated
  data-driven sampling into in-situ cosmological simulations to reduce I/O bottlenecks,
  and at Uniform-Agri, where I developed scalable disease detection algorithms for
  animal health. Collectively, my research and professional experiences reflect a
  dual focus of advancing accurate and scalable methods for early disease detection
  and strengthening research software engineering practices that improve usability,
  accessibility, and impact of advanced computing across disciplines.
motivation: "I am interested in attending the US-RSE25 Building Engagement program
  because it offers a chance to broaden my perspective on research software engineering
  beyond my current experiences at Virginia Techâ€™s Advanced Research Computing (ARC).
  I want to gain a clearer understanding of the different career paths within RSE
  and related roles, while also connecting with peers and professionals who are actively
  shaping this growing community. The programâ€™s emphasis on networking will be especially
  valuable as I explore how research facilitation and software development are practiced
  across institutions and disciplines. I am also excited about the opportunity to
  attend conference sessions that directly align with both my professional work and
  research interests. For example, sessions such as â€œBuilding Confidence in What
  We Build: Correctness in Research Software in the Age of AIâ€\x9D and â€œReal-world
  Impacts of Generative AI in the Research Software Engineering and Data Science Workplaceâ€\x9D
  will help me better understand how the community is addressing the challenges and
  opportunities AI introduces to scientific software and workflows. I am equally drawn
  to â€œUser-facing tutorials as code: reproducible and reliable tutorials with CI/CDâ€\x9D
  since developing usable, accessible, and reproducible training materials is an important
  part of my responsibilities at ARC. Finally, I plan to participate in the Biology
  and Health Applications session, which directly connects to my Ph.D. research on
  graph-based anomaly detection for early disease detection. Engaging with others
  applying RSE practices in healthcare will allow me to place my work in a broader
  context and help me identify opportunities for collaboration and real-world impact."
