  systems, sustainable software); High-Performance Computing
abstract: In recent years, multiple concurrent trends, including the proliferation
  of AI and other data-driven analyses, rising CPU core counts, and the relative stagnation
  of DRAM performance and capacity scaling, have combined to place enormous strain
  on modern memory systems. At the same time, several new technologies (e.g., high-bandwidth
  and non-volatile memories), as well as new memory interconnect options (e.g., Compute
  Express Link), are bringing new capabilities that can potentially address the limitations
  of conventional memory hardware. As a result, many computing systems are adopting
  a diverse mix of memory devices and organizations, with the hope that the unique
  benefits and capabilities of different technologies can be seamlessly combined into
  a single architecture. The Simplified Interface to Complex Memory (SICM) project
  aims to create new tools and infrastructure for applications that execute on architectures
  with complex memory resources. SICM currently includes a low-level interface that
  allows applications to view and manage heterogeneous resources directly as well
  as a high-level interface with tools and facilities to manage memory resources automatically,
  without requiring changes to application software.
