abstract: Aerosols are small particles (&lt;~10 microns in diameter) that are suspended
  in a gas, like the Earthâ€™s atmosphere. These particles are central to understanding
  the water cycle and transport of nutrients within the Earth System. A complete understanding
  cannot be provided without ground-based and vertically resolved observations, particularly
  for aerosol-cloud interactions. The goal of this study is to analyze diverse and
  large datasets collected by the U.S. DOE Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM)
  mobile facility during campaigns that we have deployed instrumentation to and are
  actively involved in with funding from the Atmospheric System Research (ASR). Two
  examples include the Surface Atmosphere Integrated Field Laboratory (SAIL) campaign
  in Colorado focused on aerosol impacts on mountain hydrology and the Eastern Pacific
  Cloud Aerosol Precipitation Experiment (EPCAPE) in California focused on aerosol-cloud
  interactions. Data includes but are not limited to those collected by the Aerosol
  Observing System (AOS) and the tethered balloon system (TBS). Specific aims are
  directed at answering key aerosol process science objectives related to identifying
  different aerosol regimes, the processes controlling their lifecycles, quantifying
  impacts on the radiative budget, and the sensitivity of cloud phase and precipitation
  to cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and ice-nucleating particle (INP) concentrations.
