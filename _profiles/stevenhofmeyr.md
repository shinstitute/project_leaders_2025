title: Extreme-scale metagenomics
topics: Computational Science Applications (i.e., bioscience, cosmology, chemistry,
  environmental science, nanotechnology, climate, etc.); Computer Science (i.e., architectures,
  compilers/languages, networks, workflow/edge, experiment automation, containers,

abstract: I am looking for students interested in working on metagenomics, especially
  large-scale metagenome assembly, and machine learning for metagenomics. Here at
  LBL we have consistently done the largest ever metagenome assemblies, and are working
  on improving our code base, as well as researching new algorithms and approaches,
  such as with AI/ML.
