status: Accept (Confirmed)
academic_interests: My academic and research interests lie at the intersection of
  cybersecurity, software engineering, and machine learning â€”three fields that are
  continually evolving and reshaping society. What first drew me to them is their
  constant change. Each new advancement or challenge creates opportunities to solve
  pressing problems. Cybersecurity, for example, is never static; as technology advances,
  so do the threats, requiring new strategies to protect sensitive data and secure
  networks. Software engineering, meanwhile, is the backbone of innovation, driving
  the development of systems and applications that directly influence how people live
  and work. I have seen this firsthand through my own projects, from building network
  tools to designing interactive web applications, where the challenge lies in creating
  solutions that are both efficient and accessible. Machine learning adds another
  layer of transformation, offering predictive and adaptive capabilities that can
  improve everything from intrusion detection to software development practices. Together,
  these fields push technology forward while presenting constant challenges to be
  solved. It is this dynamic nature, balance of problem-solving, innovation, and societal
  impact, that inspires me to continue exploring their intersections.
motivation: I am interested in attending the US-RSE25 conference Building Engagement
  program because it offers the chance to learn directly from professionals in research
  software engineering while building connections that can guide my future academic
  and career path. Engaging with researchers and practitioners will help me understand
  how their work is structured and how I can apply similar strategies in my own projects.
  I want to gain insight into innovative practices that I can integrate into my work
  in cybersecurity, software engineering, and machine learning. Additionally, I see
  this conference as an opportunity to explore research collaborations and potential
  career paths in software engineering. Beyond technical growth, I am also motivated
  by the chance to volunteer or connect with initiatives that support youth interested
  in computer science. Attending the conference will not only deepen my understanding
  of research software engineering but also align with my broader goal of creating
  opportunities and exposure for the next generation in STEM.
