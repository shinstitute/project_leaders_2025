department: Physics
status: Accept (Confirmed)
academic_interests: I'm currently majoring in computer engineering, and I have a strong
  interest in software development, its applications in scientific research, and tools
  for teaching STEM. This past summer, I participated in the NuSTEAM program, where
  I learned more about nuclear and particle physics and different computational methods
  used in research, which caught my special attention since I discovered the importance
  of software engineering in the results of scientific research using different software
  and programming techniques such as Monte Carlo Methods to simulate data as real-life
  events, and using them as experimental data. This pro I am also very interested
  in mentoring and teaching in technical fields.
motivation: I want to be more involved in the engineering and scientific community.
  I really want to know a diversity of opinions, fields, and people interested in
  the same topics as me, who can offer a different and fresh perspective. I hope to
  build professional connections and explore the different opportunities to improve
  my path.
