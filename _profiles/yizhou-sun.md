abstract: Chemical reactions power everything from new medicines to sustainable materials—but
  predicting how molecules transform under different conditions is still hard. Our
  project builds AI models that “learn” reaction behavior from data, aiming to (1)
  capture how 3D molecular structures evolve from reactants through high-energy transition
  states to products, (2) predict outcomes of individual reactions by combining 3D
  molecular information with experimental steps, and (3) plan multi-step synthetic
  routes with interpretable reasoning. Students and faculty will help develop and
  evaluate deep learning systems (e.g., graph neural networks, diffusion models, and
  language-model–based planners), curate datasets, and test ideas on open benchmarks.
  This work blends modern AI with chemistry and has direct impact on faster drug discovery,
  greener catalysis, and more efficient materials design. The summer experience can
  be tailored to backgrounds ranging from applied ML to computational chemistry, with
  mentored sub-projects that emphasize scientific rigor, reproducibility, and open
  research practices.
desired_skills: "-Strong programming in Python; experience with PyTorch/JAX or similar
  DL frameworks -Interest or experience in at least one: deep learning for molecules
  (GNNs, diffusion, transformers), NLP/RAG for scientific text, or computational chemistry
  (e.g., DFT, reaction mechanisms, conformations) -Familiarity with scientific Python
  stack (NumPy, pandas), version control (Git), and good experiment hygiene (reproducible
  runs, logging) -Nice-to-have: RDKit/cheminformatics; 3D geometry; thermodynamics/kinetics
  basics; HPC or multi-GPU training -We especially welcome advanced undergraduates
  and graduate students who have prior research experience in deep learning or computational
  chemistry and are excited about interdisciplinary collaboration"
comments: "-Mentoring & pairing: We will pair each participant with a UCLA CS PhD
  mentor; weekly 1:1s and group meetings ensure steady progress. -Project tracks:
  (A) 3D reaction dynamics modeling, (B) reaction-outcome prediction with multimodal
  inputs, (C) multi-step retrosynthesis with retrieval-augmented reasoning. -Deliverables:
  Open-source code with reproducible scripts; a short workshop paper or poster; optional
  preprint if results warrant. - Onsite details: Summer 2026 at UCLA (Los Angeles,
  CA). Start/end dates flexible within SRP windows. - Accessibility: Projects can
  be adjusted to fit primarily-ML or primarily-chemistry backgrounds while keeping
  a strong collaboration core"
