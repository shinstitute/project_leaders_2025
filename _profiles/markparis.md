abstract: The Theoretical Division at Los Alamos National Laboratory brings a diverse
  array of expertise to understanding nuclear fusion and fission reactions -- the
  fundamental, underlying component of systems driven by nuclear fuels. Exciting,
  recent developments in confined fusion systems at facilities around the world demonstrate
  that terrestrial nuclear fusion is attainable, reinforcing the importance of understanding
  the basic nuclear reactions governing these systems. In addition to their relevance
  in the production of terrestrial energy reactors, nuclear reactions are foundational
  elements in understanding energy production and structure of stars, the ``Big Bang''
  of the early universe, and the extreme phenomena of explosive supernovae and their
  production of neutron stars and black holes. Our mentoring team (Hlophe, Lovell
  &amp; Paris) leverages the diverse personal backgrounds and expertise of its members
  to provide effective mentorship for students from a wide variety of socioeconomic
  environments and levels of academic preparation. Theoretical Division scientists
  seek to broaden and deepen our research portfolio in theoretical and computational
  nuclear physics. We employ standard, few- and many-body techniques in combination
  with optimization methods, to more efficiently investigate reactions of importance
  for these sorts of applications in fundamental science, nuclear safety and security,
  and nuclear energy.
