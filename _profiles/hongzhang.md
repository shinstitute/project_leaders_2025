organization: Argonne National Laboratory
title: Scientific Computing using the PETSc/TAO Library on Exascale Machines
topics: Computational Science Applications (i.e., bioscience, cosmology, chemistry,
  environmental science, nanotechnology, climate, etc.); High-Performance Computing
abstract: Robust, efficient, and scalable numerical solvers for simulations based
  on partial differential equations (PDEs) and networks are at the heart of computational
  science. PETSc, the Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation (https://petsc.org),
  is a suite of data structures and routines for the scalable (parallel) solution
  of scientific applications modeled by PDEs, including related functionality for
  numerical optimization in TAO (Toolkit for Advanced Optimization). This project
  will focus on advances in PETSc/TAO composable solvers, which provide the core of
  scalable multiphysics and multiscale applications, including fusion, geosciences,
  power grids, nuclear energy, and more. Areas of potential work include developing
  efficient and scalable algorithms for linear, nonlinear, and timestepping solvers;
  creating example programs to demonstrate functionality and explore performance on
  extreme-scale architectures; and advancing new capabilities as motivated by the
  needs of data-driven computing and machine learning. Students are expected to gain
  hands-on numerical programming experience on state- of-the-art parallel computers.
  Students will apply the algorithms and techniques learned to a project in either
  their own field (particularly encouraged) or suggested by the mentor.
