organization: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
title: HPC-scale data science for applications
topics: Data Science (i.e., data analytics, data management &amp; storage systems,
  visualization); High-Performance Computing; Machine Learning and AI
abstract: Modern Department of Energy science missions from cosmology to biosecurity
  to climate to computer security to fusion are collecting increasingly enormous datasets
  whose exploitation requires novel approaches and algorithms. For example, the Vera
  C. Rubin Observatory (https://www.lsst.org/) will produce 20 trillion bytes of cosmology
  image data per night for 10 years, which is well beyond the throughput capabilities
  of conventional astronomy codes. Furthermore, nucleotide, protein, and antibody
  sequence catalogues continue to grow in both observation size and count, and so
  require novel solutions for even basic machine learning tasks such as clustering.
  Our group works on solutions to these and other problems that are scalable, fast,
  and both theoretically and statistically motivated. This summer project will involve
  implementing data science codes for deployment on Lawrence Livermore's statoe-of-the-art
  computers in service to improving the nation's ability to handle one of these critical
  problems. We expect the project to involve collaborating with several subject matter
  experts depending on the specifics of the task, which could include physicists,
  applied mathematicians, computer scientists, and statisticians.
