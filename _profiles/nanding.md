title: Explore the performance of GPU-initiated communications and CPU-initiated communication
  on heterogeneous architectures
topics: Computer Science (i.e., architectures, compilers/languages, networks, workflow/edge,
  experiment automation, containers, neuromorphic computing, programming models, operating
  systems, sustainable software); High-Performance Computing
abstract: Effective programming models offer programmers the ability to harness the
  capabilities of the underlying platform. For decades, the CPU-initiated Message
  Passing Interface (MPI) has become a de facto standard for communication among processes
  running on distributed memory systems. As high-performance GPU computing becomes
  the trend, GPU-initiated communication becomes a viable solution for multi-GPU scaling.
  However, the lack of deep understanding of GPU-initiated communication performance
  and its impact on an application's performance becomes a hurdle. As such, the proposed
  topic is to explore the performance of GPU-initiated communications and CPU-initiated
  communication by using or creating representative benchmarks on Perlmutter, Frontier,
  and possibly Aurora. The work may includes writing benchmark using CPU- and GPU-initiated
  communication.
