abstract: The most expensive part of many simulations is the linear solves. Preconditioners
  are critical to accelerate iterative solvers for large, sparse problems. We will
  develop and implement algebraic preconditioners that can be used as a black-box
  for a wide variety of matrices. We propose a new variation of incomplete factorizations.
  An initial implementation may be done in Matlab or Python, but the eventual goal
  is to do a parallel implementation and study its performance. If good results are
  obtained, a research publication is a strong possibility. The software may potentially
  become part of the Trilinos framework, and thus accessible to thousands of researchers
  world-wide.
