project_title: Searching Stable Chemical Space through Computational Methods using
  Multi-objectives Genetic Algorithm
status: Accept (Confirmed)
abstract: "Understanding the stability of crystalline materials is central to designing
  new functional compounds. In this work, we integrate Phonopy, a first-principles
  phonon calculation package, with PyGAD, a Python-based library for multi-objectives
  genetic algorithms, to systematically search stable regions of chemical space and
  structural stability. Phonopy enables the calculation of phonon dispersion relations,
  where the presence or absence of imaginary vibrational modes determines dynamical
  stability. These results are coupled with PyGADâ€™s multi-objective genetic algorithm
  (MOGA), where Bornâ€“von KÃ¡rmÃ¡n force constants evolve across generations to efficiently
  search parameter space and identify Pareto-optimal solutions. The workflow produces
  a â€œstability mapâ€\x9D for body-centered cubic (BCC) structures such as Fe and
  V, balancing stability criteria with agreement to experimental phonon spectra. Importantly,
  all simulations are executed on the National Energy Research Scientific Computing
  Center (NERSC) JupyterHub platform, which provides scalable high-performance computing
  resources and a reproducible environment for running optimization-driven phonon
  calculations. By combining phonon-based lattice dynamics with evolutionary algorithms
  on HPC infrastructure, this framework demonstrates a transferable and efficient
  strategy for navigating chemical space, accelerating materials discovery, and enabling
  high-throughput stability screening."
academic_interests: My academic and research interests focus on advancing the role
  of data-driven decision making, machine learning, and scalable software tools in
  computational materials science. While my current work applies multi-objective optimization
  and phonon analysis to study the stability of body-centered cubic (BCC), my broader
  goal is to build generalizable computational frameworks for all types of crystal
  structures that integrate physics-based modeling with artificial intelligence. I
  am especially interested in how machine learning models can accelerate scientific
  discovery by identifying hidden patterns across diverse datasets, ranging from phonon
  spectra to large-scale materials databases. My long-term vision is to combine machine
  learning, optimization, and HPC to create decision-support frameworks that guide
  experimental efforts, reduce computational costs, and accelerate the design of sustainable
  materials for applications in energy, infrastructure, and advanced technologies.
motivation: I am interested in attending the US-RSE25 conference Building Engagement
  program because it directly aligns with both my career goals as a computational
  scientist and my passion for research software engineering (RSE). My academic journey
  from mathematics to computational science has shown me how critical high-quality,
  sustainable software is for advancing research. Through building molecular dynamics
  simulations, implementing genetic algorithms, and now developing multi-objective
  optimization workflows with Phonopy and PyGAD on NERSC JupyterHub, I have experienced
  firsthand the impact of well-designed software pipelines on accelerating discovery.
  The Building Engagement program offers a unique opportunity to connect with the
  wider RSE community, exchange ideas with peers who are also bridging science and
  software and learn from leaders who are shaping best practices in reproducibility,
  scalability, and community-driven software. Attending US-RSE25 will help me refine
  my own approach to sustainable research software while contributing my perspective
  as someone integrating optimization, phonon analysis, and machine learning potentials
  into computational materials science. Ultimately, this experience will strengthen
  my ability to contribute to open-source frameworks, mentor future scientists, and
  build bridges between computational research and the communities it serves.
