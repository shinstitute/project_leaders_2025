abstract: Numerical computer simulation models are used to predict the behavior of
  physical systems such as fluids or materials. These simulations are based on underlying
  partial differential equations (PDEs). Neural partial differential equations (NPDEs)
  are a machine learning (ML) approach that replaces these physical governing equations
  with a neural network. This ML approach is used when the equations describing a
  systemâ€™s behavior are not fully understood from a physical perspective, because
  it permits (1) learning unknown governing equations from data, and (2) quantifying
  uncertainties in the mathematical form of learned equations. "Hybrid" simulations
  are also possible, with some of the equations specified from physical principles
  and others learned from data as neural networks. In this project, we will explore
  the potential for NPDEs to describe various physical systems, such as the heat diffusion
  equation, or more complex systems like the reaction-diffusion equations describing
  spatially-distributed chemical reactions, or the Cahn-Hilliard equations describing
  phase separation in self-assembling nanomaterials. This can include studying the
  ability of the neural network to emulate the behavior of the original system, as
  well as Bayesian statistical and mathematical dimension reduction methods to efficiently
  quantify uncertainties of the NPDE in a reduced-dimensional space of neural network
  parameters.
