title: OpenMP Common Core with Python
topics: Computer Science (i.e., architectures, compilers/languages, networks, workflow/edge,
  experiment automation, containers, neuromorphic computing, programming models, operating
  systems, sustainable software); High-Performance Computing
abstract: "OpenMP is the de facto standard for writing parallel applications for shared
  memory computers. Born ~25 years ago in 1997, it runs on just about every shared
  memory platform on the market. Itâ€™s also very complicated with the Language Specification
  of over 600 pages. Most OpenMP programmers however only use around 21 items from
  the Language Specification. We call these 21 items the â€œOpenMP Common Coreâ€\x9D.
  By focusing on the common core, we make OpenMP what it was always meant to be: a
  simple API for parallel application programmers. Most C/C++/Fortran compilers have
  OpenMP support. The OpenMP Common Core Book published in 2019 by Tim Mattson, Helen
  He, and Alice Koniges provided example codes mostly in C (plus the Fortran supplement),
  to illustrate OpenMP Common Core concepts. PyOMP is a new project based on Numba
  to allow Python programmers to use OpenMP directives in their Python code. The proposed
  SRP project is to learn OpenMP Common Core first, then install PyOMP on the NERSC
  system or your own laptop and implement selected OpenMP Common Core example codes
  in Python."
