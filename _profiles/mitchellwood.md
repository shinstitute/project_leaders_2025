abstract: Experiments to study materials extreme environments (temperature, pressure,
  strain rate) are challenging and time consumptive, therefore we turn to modeling
  tools to refine and predict outcomes beforehand. Ideal computational models balance
  absolute physical accuracy against approximate but computationally lightweight constitutive
  inputs. In addition, with exascale super computers arriving in the near future,
  it is timely to ask whether our simulation software is capable of matching this
  unprecedented computing capability. While many research challenges in material physics,
  chemistry and biology lie just out of reach on peta-scale machines due to length
  and time restrictions inherent to Molecular Dynamics and electronic structure methods,
  questions of the accuracy of our predictions will continue to linger. This is particularly
  true for complex alloys, composites of disparate components as well as materials
  in extremes of temperature, pressure and radiation exposure. Here we aim to break
  the normal accuracy-cost tradeoffs by using machine learned models that scale to
  the largest supercomputing platforms in the world.
