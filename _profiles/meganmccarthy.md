title: Accelerating machine-learned interatomic potential development for nanoscale
  materials science
topics: Computational Science Applications (i.e., bioscience, cosmology, chemistry,
  environmental science, nanotechnology, climate, etc.)
abstract: Our group uses a combination of atomistic multiscale simulation methods,
  paired with machine learning techniques, to create powerful near-quantum-accurate
  models for atomic interactions. These models are called machine-learned interatomic
  potentials and are used in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, which simulate a
  material atom-by-atom. MD is widely used to both understand nanoscale behavior in
  well-known engineering materials such as iron and silicon and also to discover and
  characterize new materials such as high entropy alloys. In our group, we look specifically
  at materials used extreme environments, such as those found inside nuclear fusion
  and fission reactors, and simulate them at very large scales on high-performance
  computing systems (HPC, also sometimes called supercomputers). Creating new interatomic
  potentials for MD is very challenging and is thus currently a huge bottleneck in
  the world of nanoscale materials modeling. The intern's project would involve working
  with an interdisciplinary team of scientists and other interns on tackling the science
  of interatomic potential development itself, with an aim to speed up production
  of these machine-learned potentials and thus accelerate materials science discovery.
  The specific project would be adjusted to the student's background and interests.
