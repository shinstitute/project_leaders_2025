topics: Computer Science (i.e., architectures, compilers/languages, networks, workflow/edge,
  experiment automation, containers, neuromorphic computing, programming models, operating
  systems, sustainable software); High-Performance Computing
abstract: The hardware landscape is constantly changing to match the needs of scientific
  applications. CPUs have provided much of the compute power, however recently the
  focus has shifted towards highly parallel GPUs and specialized units customized
  for specific operations like matrix multiply or Fourier transforms. As such, library
  and framework developers need to be always active to adapt the software but also
  keen on offering information to hardware developers for better hardware support.
  Moving forward, more emphasis should be put on hardware-software co-design, namely
  developing strategies to optimize certain algorithms, creating models to guide the
  optimizations and the hardware itself, and then automating the process by using
  high level frameworks like JAX or others. This becomes even more critical nowadays
  when computation is applied on data that exhibits dynamic and sparse behavior. This
  additional dimension makes the search space for efficient algorithms and hardware
  harder. Therefore, the work I am doing is looking into ways to reduce the search
  space and offer solutions for various scientific applications in a short amount
  of time, whether those solutions are all in software or whether some components
  make use of specialized hardware.
