biography: Dr. Agniv Sengupta is a Sr. Computational Research Scientist and the Machine
  Learning Team Lead of the Center for Western Weather and Water Extremes (CW3E),
  Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego. His research interests involve
  the prediction of high-impact weather events using artificial intelligence and machine
  learning. His current projects focus on improving the prediction skill of weather
  (0-10 days), subseasonal (1-6 weeks), and seasonal (1 to 6 months) forecasts in
  the Western United States. This involves exploring innovative algorithms and approaches,
  advancing models for predictions across multiple timescales, and developing decision-support
  tools and forecast products in coordination with stakeholders. Dr. Sengupta earned
  his Ph.D. (2020) and M.S. (2016) in Atmospheric and Oceanic Science from the University
  of Maryland College Park, and was subsequently a postdoctoral scholar (2020-21)
  at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) prior to joining CW3E.

abstract: Accurate weather forecasting has traditionally relied on numerical weather
  prediction models, which require significant computational resources. In this context,
  artificial intelligence (AI) models have revolutionized the domain of weather prediction
  in the past 2-3 years, emerging as computationally efficient alternatives. As part
  of our NAIRR Pilot project, we are developing such AI weather modeling and prediction
  capabilities over the North Pacific and the western United States, specifically
  for extreme weather phenomena such as atmospheric rivers (ARs). In this work, we
  utilize state-of-the-art AI advancements, including graph neural networks and Diffusion-based
  Generative AI methods. Additionally, we employ these models to generate a large
  number of realizations of future weather, enhancing the tracking of AR storms from
  their genesis over the Pacific to their impact over the U.S. West Coast.
