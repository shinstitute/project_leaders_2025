abstract: This project aims to understand degradation at the electrolyte-electrode
  interfaces during cell preparation and electrochemical cycling. We will leverage
  various computational methods developed at LLNL to address how degradation precursors
  are formed during initial chemical or electrochemical reactions and how these precursors
  dynamically evolve to form an inhomogeneous solid electrolyte interphase (SEI).
  In addition to the understanding of SEI formation, we will elucidate the implication
  of SEI formation to ion transport kinetics and address the impact of microstructural
  features of the SEI.
