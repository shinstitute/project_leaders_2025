biography: Edgar J. Lobaton is a Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer
  Engineering (ECE) at North Carolina State University (NCSU). He joined the department
  in 2011. Lobaton earned his B.S. in Mathematics and Electrical engineering from
  Seattle University in 2004. He completed his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering and
  Computer Sciences from the University of California, Berkeley in 2009. Lobaton was
  engaged in research at Alcatel-Lucent Bell Labs in 2005 and 2009. He was awarded
  the NSF CAREER Award in 2016. He was also awarded the 2009 Computer Innovation Fellows
  post-doctoral fellowship and conducted research in the Department of Computer Science
  at the University of North Carolina (UNC) at Chapel Hill from 2009 until 2011. In
  2023, he received the William F. Lane Outstanding Teaching from the ECE Department.
  In 2024, he received the University Faculty Scholars and the Outstanding Teacher
  Awards from NC State. His research focuses on the integration of AI, and physical
  and probabilistic modeling applied to cyber-physical systems in areas such as wearable
  health monitoring, rehabilitation robotics, agriculture and biological imaging.
project_title: AI-Guided Learning in JupyterHub Environments
nairr_project: Providing GPU Resources for Deep Learning at NC State
topical_areas: Applied Computer Science; Educational Sciences; Electrical, Electronic,
  and Information Engineering
abstract: Ready to build the future of coding education? This high-impact research
  project invites motivated students to integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) into
  the JupyterHub platform for technical coursework, with the core goal of transforming
  the LLM from a passive tutor into an active, reflective guide. You'll be responsible
  for developing and deploying the LLM interface within Jupyter Notebooks, implementing
  a fine-grained tracking and logging mechanism to capture student-LLM interaction
  data, and creating prompt engineering strategies that strictly enforce the LLM's
  role as a "navigator", while offering directional guidance, samples and logic critiques
  rather than direct solutions. This work lies at the critical intersection of AI,
  Human-Computer Interaction, and Educational Technology, offering a unique opportunity
  to directly influence how the next generation of technical professionals learns
  to code by leveraging AI as a powerful learning partner.
desired_skills: "- Proficiency in Python programming - Familiarity with the use of
  the API for any LLM (e.g., OpenAI API) - [Desired but not required] Familiarity
  with Kubernetes"
comments: As part of this project, you will also help with expanding on the features
  of our existing JupyterHub infrastructure through JetStream2.
