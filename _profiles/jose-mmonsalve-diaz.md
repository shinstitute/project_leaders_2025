title: A learning experience of compilers, runtime systems and parallel programmin
topics: Computer Science (i.e., architectures, compilers/languages, networks, workflow/edge,
  experiment automation, containers, neuromorphic computing, programming models, operating
  systems, sustainable software)
abstract: High-Performance Computing is an exciting field that constantly pushes the
  limits of computation. HPC is a complex field. Not only is it necessary to have
  scientific knowledge of the applications, but also to have a deep understanding
  of how systems work. The more knowledge of the systems and tools, the higher the
  scientific impact could be. In this project, we seek to allow learning about compilers,
  runtime systems, and parallel programming. We aim to find a project that considers
  the needs of the current projects at ANL in addition to the professional development
  of the participants. We plan on using parallel programming models such as OpenMP,
  SYCL, OpenACC, and others. We explore innovation in their runtime systems and compilers.
  We will use the LLVM compiler infrastructure as one of the most important compilers
  in the area of HPC. By the end, we would like to encourage participants to 1) be
  part of the LLVM community, 2) better understand compilers, runtime systems, and
  parallel programming, 3) get involved in the area of HPC, and 4) create the necessary
  grounds for professional development.
