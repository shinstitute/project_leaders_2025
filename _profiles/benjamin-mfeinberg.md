title: Software and System Architectures for Analog Linear Algebra Accelerators
topics: Computer Science (i.e., architectures, compilers/languages, networks, workflow/edge,
  experiment automation, containers, neuromorphic computing, programming models, operating
  systems, sustainable software); Machine Learning and AI; National Security
abstract: Analog computing has significant potential to enable new applications on
  autonomous systems by providing order-of-magnitude improvements in computational
  efficiency. Unfortunately, most of the work on analog hardware has focused on device
  and circuit optimization rather than flexible and programmable systems. To remedy
  this issue, this project will develop components of a system software toolchain
  including tools to effectively map applications to the target hardware and manage
  other runtime components. Additionally, this project will use Sandia's Structural
  Simulation toolkit to evaluate the developed software on a simulated system and
  evaluate potential architectural optimizations. As part of this evaluation, we will
  consider trade offs between programmability and system-level performance and efficiency
  for a variety of applications. This project will involve interdisciplinary collaboration
  with both application and circuit/device experts to ensure that the developed toolchain
  is useful for application developers and provide feedback on architectural challenges
  that could be mitigated at the circuit or device level.
