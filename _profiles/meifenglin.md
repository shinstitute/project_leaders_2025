  High-Performance Computing
abstract: Computing plays an essential role in High Energy Physics (HEP) research.
  From the ab initio theory calculations using numerical techniques such as lattice
  QCD, to detector simulations and data analysis for the particle physics experiments
  such as those at the Large Hadron Collider, the computational demand has been growing
  rapidly due to the increased, exabyte-scale, data volume from the experiments and
  enhanced precision needed to probe new physics beyond the Standard Model. The exascale
  massively parallel supercomputers hold the promise to provide orders of magnitude
  more computing power to support this fundamental physics research. However, the
  diverse heterogenous architectures in the exascale systems present many challenges
  to the scientific software developers. This SRP project will develop and benchmark
  mini code examples based on the use cases we have extracted as part of the High
  Energy Physics Center for Computational Excellence project (www.anl.gov/hep-cce).
  The goal is to use these "mini-apps" to track the progress of the software stack
  to support performance portability, the notion that a single source code can run
  efficiently on multiple architectures, and the ways to address it. The participants
  will be exposed to both the physics motifs and computational challenges in high
  energy physics.
