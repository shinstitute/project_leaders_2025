project_title: "Adaptive Trend Extraction in Financial Time Series Using â„“â‚\x81
  Trend Filtering"
status: Accept (Confirmed)
abstract: "Extracting underlying trends from noisy time series is a fundamental challenge
  in fields such as economics, finance, and environmental science. Traditional methods
  such as the Hodrick Prescott (HP) filter apply an â„“â‚‚ penalty that smooths curvature
  but often oversmooths abrupt changes, limiting their usefulness in detecting structural
  breaks. Building on the theoretical foundation of Kim, Koh, Boyd, and Gorinevsky
  (2009), this project applies â„“â‚\x81 trend filtering which replaces the â„“â‚‚
  penalty with an â„“â‚\x81 penalty on second order differences to real financial
  data. The â„“â‚\x81 approach produces piecewise linear trend estimates where slope
  changes correspond to structural events and it achieves computational complexity
  comparable to HP filtering. Using daily log transformed S and P 500 index data from
  early 2025, we implemented gradient descent optimization and compared both filters.
  The â„“â‚\x81 filter more effectively identified sudden drops and recoveries, while
  residual analysis confirmed improved noise removal without oversmoothing. These
  results demonstrate â„“â‚\x81 trend filtering as a practical and scalable alternative
  for uncovering meaningful regime shifts in financial and other time series."
academic_interests: "I am interested in the point where software engineering, mathematics,
  and machine learning come together to solve real-world problems. What excites me
  most is working on systems that are not only theoretical but also usable and reliable.
  I enjoy thinking about how algorithms and models can be turned into tools that help
  researchers, students, and practitioners in different fields. Last summer I worked
  in an NSF REU where I studied â„“â‚\x81 trend filtering for financial time series.
  I compared it with the Hodrick Prescott filter and learned how different mathematical
  models behave when faced with sudden changes in market data. That project gave me
  a strong appreciation for both optimization and statistical modeling, and how these
  methods can uncover hidden structure in complex signals. At the same time, I like
  building infrastructure-level software. For example, I developed a distributed market
  data microservice that streamed millions of datapoints with reliability, and I am
  also working on an offline AI tutor designed for students in low-connectivity regions.
  These projects remind me that research software engineering is about more than writing
  code â€” it is about creating systems that are scalable, reproducible, and useful
  to a community. Going forward, I want to continue studying high-performance computing,
  research software practices, and applied mathematics while contributing to open
  communities. My goal is to grow as a researcher who not only builds models but also
  ships software that makes research more accessible and impactful."
motivation: "I am interested in attending the US-RSE25 Building Engagement program
  because I want to deepen my involvement in the research software engineering community
  and learn from people who are setting standards for reproducibility, scalability,
  and impact in research. Much of my recent work has shown me how critical good software
  practices are to science, but I have not yet had the chance to connect closely with
  a professional RSE community. Through experiences such as my NSF REU at Louisiana
  Tech University, where I implemented â„“â‚\x81 trend filtering for financial time
  series, and my role at AfterQuery building modular LLM evaluation pipelines, I have
  seen how the reliability of research outcomes depends on the quality of the supporting
  software. I want to attend this conference to engage with others who share this
  mission and to gain new perspectives on how to develop software that can support
  open and sustainable science. I am also drawn to the Building Engagement program
  because of its emphasis on mentorship, inclusion, and early career development.
  As someone from a non-traditional background, I value the chance to learn directly
  from established RSE professionals and to contribute my own experiences, such as
  leading the Notion x Grambling Hackathon, where I worked to make STEM opportunities
  accessible to new learners. Attending US-RSE25 will give me the chance to grow my
  skills, expand my network, and align my career trajectory with a community that
  values both technical excellence and openness in research."
