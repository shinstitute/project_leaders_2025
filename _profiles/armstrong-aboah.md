biography: I am an Assistant Professor at the North Dakota State University. An ingenious
  and resourceful Transportation Data Scientist with a proven track record of success
  in research and hands-on experience developing cutting-edge database solutions,
  statistical modeling, data products, and computer vision systems aimed at improving
  transportation system management and operations. Has worked as an architect and
  application developer on a variety of projects that required the use of data mining
  and machine learning models to solve large-scale, complex, and difficult transportation
  problems. I am broadly interested in computer vision and machine learning. My research
  involves visual reasoning, vision and language, image generation, air taxis, naturalistic
  studies, and autonomous vehicles.

abstract: Traffic intersections remain critical points of vulnerability in transportation
  infrastructure, accounting for 20% of vehicular accidents and over 7,000 annual
  fatalities in the United States. Current intersection monitoring systems, relying
  on basic motion detection or single-class object detection, struggle with complex
  scenarios involving multiple road users and varying environmental conditions. This
  research proposes PRIME (Predictive Real-time Intersection Monitoring Engine), a
  foundational traffic intersection monitoring algorithm that integrates advanced
  deep learning techniques for multi-class video object detection and trajectory prediction.
  This project directly aligns with NAIRR priority areas by creating open-source foundation
  models for specific applications and utilizing experimental data from sensors and
  detectors. The proposed system employs a novel object detection architecture with
  enhanced feature pyramid networks and combines transformer encoders with graph neural
  networks to achieve robust object detection and accurate 5-second trajectory predictions.
  Our technical objectives include developing a multi-class detection system with
  over 95% accuracy, implementing proactive trajectory prediction, and generating
  anonymous traffic patterns for urban planning. The project will be executed utilizing
  TACC Frontera GPU resources for model development and training. We will also release
  our codebase and make our annotated dataset publicly available with the aim of establishing
  a common foundation for intersection monitoring systems.
desired_skills: A good programming background, like Python. Familiarity with computer
  vision.
