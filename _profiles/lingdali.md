title: Building a Program Database to Facilitate Machine Learning-based Computing
  Research
topics: Computer Science (i.e., architectures, compilers/languages, networks, workflow/edge,
  experiment automation, containers, neuromorphic computing, programming models, operating
  systems, sustainable software); Machine Learning and AI
abstract: Machine learning (ML) has shown great success in many domains, and increasing
  efforts are applying ML in the field of computer science and engineering, for instance,
  to design more efficient hardware and software. Due to its data driven nature, it
  requires thousands if not millions of programs to generate training data in ML techniques,
  and the computing research community does not have such a collection of programs
  in hand. Particularly, traditional benchmarks are short in number, and source code
  hosting websites (e.g., GitHub) have abundant code snippets instead of executable
  programs. This project aims to bridge this gap by creating a database including
  a large number of executable programs. The main task of this project is to collect/write
  programs that stretch both computing power and memory capability of modern computers,
  leveraging coding exercise websites such as LeetCode and CodeForces. This database
  will subsequently be used for program performance predictive model training and
  testing. Besides the main purpose mentioned above, this project will also help students
  sharp their programming skills and benefit their future careers in both academia
  and industry, giving the fact that these coding exercise websites are the de facto
  means to prepare technical interviews.
