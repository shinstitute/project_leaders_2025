  visualization); Machine Learning and AI
abstract: Nuclear Data libraries, which contain information about the interaction
  of particles with nuclei, are carefully curated from experimental data and theoretical
  predictions. This data includes details about nuclear reactions, such as their reaction
  probability (cross section), decay yields, spectra of the outgoing particles etc.
  and are used to understand/predict the behavior of particles in nuclear systems,
  such as nuclear reactors, astrophysical processes, radiography, gamma-based interrogation
  techniques etc. As such, any inaccuracies and imprecision in the nuclear data gets
  propagated to the uncertainties in the application of interest. Until recently,
  most general purpose nuclear data libraries have utilized Bayesian approach to tune
  the theory model input parameters to fit the experimental data. In this project,
  the student(s) will explore machine learning based approach to combine the theoretical
  models with experimental data to come up with evaluated nuclear data for specific
  reaction channels and physics observables. Upon the successful completion of this
  work, the work will be published in peer reviewed journals.
