  AI
abstract: MPICH is a widely used, open-Â­source implementation of the MPI message
  passing standard. It has been ported to many platforms and used by several vendors
  and research groups as the basis for their own MPI implementations. We are looking
  for collaboration at all levels of the software stack. Including, but not limited
  to, low-level networking libraries, shared memory, collective algorithms, performance
  testing/tuning, CI/CD, documentation, and more!
