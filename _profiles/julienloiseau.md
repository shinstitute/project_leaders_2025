abstract: 'The CDSS 2023 subject will focus on modeling radiation hydrodynamics using
  the FleCSI framework. This work can be decomposed in two steps: the radiative transfer
  library and the hydrodynamics code. The hydrodynamics part will feature a mesh based
  implementation for our test, either Lagrangian or Eulerian. In the radiation library
  implementation, we will use flux limited diffusion as a starting point. Multiple
  different approaches can then be explored for better treatment of the radiation
  energy, such as the multigroup method. This base code will enable us to run interesting
  simulations including Lowrie radiating shock, Su-Olson Marshak wave, and ablation
  problems. The complexification of supercomputers, in both number of nodes and on-node
  hybridization, forces us to rethink our approach to high performance computing.
  In this context, task-based parallelism provides a promising path forward. The summer
  school proposes to use the FleCSI framework as a base for the simulations. FleCSI
  is a compile time configurable framework from LANL which supports the development
  of multiphysics applications. LANL is funding a next generation exascale supercomputer
  called Venado. The aim for the summer school is to run the simulations at scale
  on Venado, taking advantage of the NVIDIA superchip.'
