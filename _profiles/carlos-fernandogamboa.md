name: Carlos Fernando Gamboa
organization: Brookhaven National Laboratory
title: Data Storage for Scientific Experiments
topics: Computer Science (i.e., architectures, compilers/languages, networks, workflow/edge,
  experiment automation, containers, neuromorphic computing, programming models, operating
  systems, sustainable software); Data Science (i.e., data analytics, data management
  &amp; storage systems, visualization)
abstract: One of the missions of the Scientific Data and Computing Center (SDCC) at
  Brookhaven National Laboratory is to provide access to storage services for a diverse
  range of High Energy Physics (HEP) scientific experiments, including LHC-ATLAS[1],
  Belle2[2], and DUNE[3]. An aggregate of 222 million files and data storage totaling
  76PB is distributed and managed by independent storage instances for each Virtual
  Organization (VO). The underlying technology used to support this storage is dCache
  [4]. Currently, we are in the process of evolving and reviewing event visualization
  and control schemes, as well as log analysis tools, to improve analytics and monitoring
  and ensure the high availability of this storage service. Additionally, we are interested
  in identifying state-of-the-art tools and techniques that allow us to anticipate
  or predict inefficient storage resource access or real time system component failures.
  Ultimately, these improvements will have a significant impact on advancing scientific
  discovery while optimizing storage resources. [1] https://home.cern/science/experiments/atlas
