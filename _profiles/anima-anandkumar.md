biography: Anima has made fundamental contributions to AI that is revolutionizing
  scientific modeling and discovery. She invented Neural Operators for learning multiscale
  phenomena that frequently occur in nature, such as fluid dynamics, material modeling
  and wave propagation. She employed Neural Operators to train the first AI-based
  high-resolution weather model, tens of thousands of times faster than existing physics-based
  forecasting. Her AI algorithms have enabled many other scientific advances such
  as modeling plasma evolution in nuclear fusion, enabling safer autonomous drone
  flights, and designing novel medical devices, drugs, and functional enzymes. Earlier
  in her career, Anima spearheaded the development of tensor methods, probabilistic
  latent variable models, and analysis of non-convex optimization. Anima is Bren Professor
  at Caltech. She previously was a Senior Director of AI Research at NVIDIA and Principal
  Scientist at Amazon Web Services. She received her B.Tech from IIT Madras, and her
  Ph.D. from Cornell University. She did her postdoctoral research at MIT and an assistant
  professorship at UC Irvine. She has received several honors such as the IEEE fellowship,
  Alfred. P. Sloan Fellowship, NSF Career Award, and Faculty Fellowships from Microsoft,
  Google, Facebook, and Adobe. She is part of the World Economic Forum's Expert Network.

abstract: Addressing global sustainability challenges requires fast, accurate, and
  generalizable modeling of complex systems in energy, climate, and infrastructure.
  Traditional high-fidelity simulations are often too slow and computationally expensive
  for timely exploration, design, and decision-making. This project leverages and
  advances neural operator frameworks to accelerate scientific simulations while adhering
  to known physical laws. By combining the expressiveness and inference speed of deep
  learning architectures with physics knowledge, these neural operators provide predictive
  surrogates for systems governed by partial differential equations, enabling scalable,
  energy-efficient computation at previously inaccessible scales. In this research,
  embedding physical constraints ensure sreliable predictions, generalizes modeling
  across diverse domains, and enables inverse design to identify system configurations
  that meet performance goals. Uncertainty quantification and formal verification
  in Lean (a theorem prover) provide further guarantees of correctness and reliability.
  Physics-informed enhancements, operator-based multi-scale learning, and robust modeling
  strategies ensure accurate long-term behavior and broad applicability to complex
  real-world systems. These tools support high-impact simulations for renewable energy,
  environmental resilience, and critical infrastructure planning. By releasing open-source
  frameworks, fostering accessibility, and prioritizing usability, this work empowers
  scientists, engineers, and students worldwide to harness advanced neural operators
  for transformative discovery, informed decision-making, and sustainable, verifiable
  solutions to urgent global challenges.
