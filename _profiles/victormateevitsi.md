  systems, sustainable software); Data Science (i.e., data analytics, data management
  &amp; storage systems, visualization); High-Performance Computing
abstract: Robotics is changing the way new technologies are manufactured, researched,
  and developed. Robots can operate at high speed, with infinite precision, and without
  fatigue. Thus, they are ideal for repetitive work in hazardous environments like
  nuclear reactors. However, designing and evaluating such systems is extremely hard.
  A digital twin is a digital replica of the physical environment, the mechanical
  components, and the entire research/production workflow. You can think of a digital
  twin as a digital reconstruction of the lab, including all robotic arms, sensors,
  desks, laboratory components, tests, and how they interact with each other. Our
  research interests include exploring how digital twins can help diagnose operational
  anomalies, understand system health, and improve overall system efficiency in Virtual
  Reality. Imagine a nuclear physicist wearing a Virtual Reality headset and safely
  assembling a novel nuclear reactor inside a Virtual Environment. They can now run
  tests and simulations, gather sensor data, and improve their design. Once they are
  satisfied with the results, they can request the physical replica of the robotic
  laboratory to assemble the reactor and perform the pre-programmed tests.
