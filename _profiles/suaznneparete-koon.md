organization: Oak Ridge National Laboratory
title: HPC/AI/Data Sci. Project-Based Curriculum Building
topics: Data Science (i.e., data analytics, data management &amp; storage systems,
  visualization); High-Performance Computing; Machine Learning and AI
abstract: One of the best ways to learn a new skill it to teach it. This project will
  focus on preparing introductory High-Performance Computing (HPC) material to enable
  individuals to gain foundational HPC skills for advanced computing and bridge the
  gap between advanced HPC programs and currently available courses in Computer Science
  undergraduate curriculum. The goal is to provide clear and easily accessible tutorials
  that will educate newcomers on the technical aspects of HPC. These tutorials will
  include definitions of commonly used HPC terms, concepts, applications, and hands-on
  programming exercises. This project will contribute to a future diverse HPC workforce
  by making HPC and Data Science more accessible, not just technically but addressing
  cultural and economic barriers to reach out to underrepresented populations. Students
  will first apply the core computing skills to smaller-scale datasets and codes and
  develop more advanced skills, such as parallelizing their code and handlining larger
  datasets. They will then appreciate the value of parallel computing and how one
  can harness the analytics capabilities of HPC to solve complex computational problems
  with high societal impact. We believe this project aligns with the goals of the
  SRP program in building the future workforce for HPC, AI, and Data science.
