project_title: 'X2Sim: Rapid digital twin creation from text and videos for natural
  hazard modeling'
status: Accept (Confirmed)
abstract: 'Traditional methods for modeling natural hazards such as landslides, floods,
  and storm surges are computationally intensive and time-consuming, thus limiting
  their applicability in effective disaster preparedness and response in real-world
  scenarios. To address this challenge, we present a novel framework, through TACCâ€™s
  HPC resources, for rapidly creating digital twins that significantly reduces the
  time, manual input, and computational resources needed for simulating the interaction
  between natural hazards and real-world 3D objects. Our X2Sim framework utilizes
  an agentic text-to-simulation Large Language Model (LLM) to generate digital twins,
  integrating two distinct 3D object generation methods: (i) A text-to-3D point cloud
  diffusion model that swiftly creates 3D point clouds from natural language descriptions,
  enabling rapid digital twin prototyping, and (ii) An efficient method for constructing
  high-fidelity point clouds from video input, allowing for more detailed digital
  twin representations of existing structures. These digital twins are integrated
  into a Graph Network-based Simulator (GNS) that models the dynamics of particle
  and fluid interactions, enabling the simulation of complex natural hazard scenarios.
  Our X2Sim system allows for adjusting simulation parameters, offering a robust tool
  for exploring various disaster scenarios and their impacts on the digital twins.
  While our digital twin framework may not match the accuracy of high-fidelity numerical
  methods, it significantly reduces computation time and complexity, making it viable
  for near-real-time applications. The X2Sim approach offers a valuable balance between
  speed and precision in digital twin creation and simulation, providing a streamlined,
  low-intervention workflow for researchers and practitioners in natural hazard modeling
  and disaster preparedness.'
academic_interests: "My academic/research interests are a combination of artificial
  intelligence, computer vision, and high-performance computing. Iâ€™m interested
  in projects that push the limits of scalability within these fields, whether that
  means training models on large datasets, running simulations, or developing tools
  that help researchers solve real-world problems faster. In the past, I have had
  the opportunity to work on projects that used HPC systems to simulate natural hazards
  and to train deep learning models. Through these experiences, I have learned that
  I really enjoyed combining technical challenges with meaningful applications. At
  the moment, I donâ€™t have a single â€œforeverâ€\x9D field nailed down yet, but
  I know I want to keep building my skills and experience in AI and HPC while applying
  them to problems that have a clear, practical impact."
motivation: I am applying to PhD programs this fall and would love the chance to connect
  with professionals, universities, and researchers from across the country. In past
  projects, I have used tools that are utilized in the field of software engineering
  research, and Iâ€™ve seen how much the right software and workflows can shape the
  success of a project. Attending the BE@US-RSE25 conference would give me the chance
  to learn how others in the RSE community design, maintain, and share these tools,
  especially in ways that make them easier for researchers from different backgrounds
  to use. If given the opportunity to participate in the BE program, I hope to see
  real examples of how large projects are organized, how teams work together across
  disciplines, and how ideas move from prototypes to something that can be used in
  real research. In the future, I want to lead a research group that bridges computational
  science with community-specific issues. I want to design tools that earn their place
  in both academic journals and city planning meetings, tools that can adapt to changing
  conditions and data sources, and tools that put predictive power directly in the
  hands of decision makers.

## Academic Interests

My academic/research interests are a combination of artificial intelligence, computer vision, and high-performance computing. Iâ€™m interested in projects that push the limits of scalability within these fields, whether that means training models on large datasets, running simulations, or developing tools that help researchers solve real-world problems faster. In the past, I have had the opportunity to work on projects that used HPC systems to simulate natural hazards and to train deep learning models. Through these experiences, I have learned that I really enjoyed combining technical challenges with meaningful applications. At the moment, I donâ€™t have a single â€œforeverâ€ field nailed down yet, but I know I want to keep building my skills and experience in AI and HPC while applying them to problems that have a clear, practical impact.
