abstract: This project aims to analyze data from isotope production experiments at
  the Cyclotron Institute, a U.S. user facility. The experiment consisted of a beam
  of lithium-6 on a natural samarium target at different energies. From the NuDat
  database a chart of nuclides and focusing on the isotopesâ€™ half-lives, stabilities,
  and properties can be used to predict outcomes of the experiments. The foils were
  counted a day after irradiation, using three high-purity germanium (HPGe) detectors.
  Background, natural samarium foils (with thicknesses of 100 and 250 micrometers),
  europium-152 source, and gold foils (with a thickness of 5 micrometers) data was
  collected on the HPGes. To analyze these spectra, the python toolkit called Curie
  was used to simplify the identification and fitting of the peaks. After calibrating
  the spectra using the europium-152 source in Curie, the resulting isotopes can be
  identified. With this data we can conclude that the isotope production of terbium-149
  via this method may be possible, but more measurements will need to be performed
  to confirm the optimal production pathway.
academic_interests: I'm interested in data science and nuclear research. I believe
  nuclear physics research has been sped up and slowed down in the wrong chronological
  order, as we need clean energy and medical tools now more than ever. My goal is
  to be part of a beneficial change of the use of nuclear potential in an era that
  needs it. I'm very interested in the tools that data science can offer to all research
  fields, from AI to sorting algorithms. The intersection of mathematics and computer
  science amazes me.
motivation: Meeting leaders and experts on software focused on STEM fields is one
  of my greatest motivations for this conference. The opportunity of mentorship or
  advises from experts in their fields will help me shape better my career and life
  goals. I want to know more about cutting edge technologies and tools used to solve
  different situations in research, as I get lost when I try to look them up on my
  own. Meeting students from different places and sharing experiences will help me
  have a better understanding of current situations outside my usual community. I
  want to know better what my options will be after grad school and my service to
  the country.
