name: Sarah Poon
organization: Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
title: 'User Interfaces for BRaVE: National Biopreparedness and Response Capabilities'
topics: Computational Science Applications (i.e., bioscience, cosmology, chemistry,
  environmental science, nanotechnology, climate, etc.); Data Science (i.e., data
  analytics, data management &amp; storage systems, visualization)
abstract: The BRaVE initiative, which is developing countermeasure against emerging
  biological treats, needs user interfaces and data dashboards to enable scientists
  developing diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics, to make sense of their data
  and make decisions for which pathways to pursue. This project will focus on trying
  to make scientific data accessible, understandable, and actionable, as part of the
  effort to be prepared for the next pandemic.
