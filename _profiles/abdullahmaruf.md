project_title: 'From MPI to ZeroMQ: Scalable Online Feedback for Serial Crystallography
  with Bayesian/ML-Ready Hooks'
status: Accept (Confirmed)
abstract: "OM (OnDA Monitor) is widely used at free-electron laser and synchrotron
  facilities for online scoring and monitoring of diffraction during serial crystallography.
  We present a re-architected parallelization layer that replaces the original MPI
  layer with a ZeroMQ (â€œZMQ-socketâ€\x9D) design that reduces external dependencies,
  improves portability across heterogeneous beamlines, and enables dynamic worker
  join/leave so monitoring can resume after interruptions without loss of accumulated
  statistics. Beyond these systems gains, we expose a lightweight probabilistic interface
  that supports Monte Carlo adaptation in the small-hit regime: sequential sampling
  updates run-time estimates of hit rate and resolution, tunes acquisition/processing
  thresholds, and provides uncertainty-aware stopping/continuation decisions to use
  beamtime efficiently. The core remains usable out-of-the-box, while optional plug-ins
  can ingest streaming features for complementary deep-learning quality scoring. Ongoing
  work targets optimization of the ZMQ layer and benchmarking Monte Carlo policies
  under realistic beam conditions, toward a portable release for routine deployment
  at beamlines."
academic_interests: My research interests focus on computational modeling and software
  development to support scientific discovery across materials science, planetary
  exploration, and high-energy experiments. I have worked on quantum simulation tools
  to study materials under extreme conditions, such as those that could inform future
  space missions by providing insights into planetary regolith and high-pressure compounds.
  This has built my experience in creating reliable computational frameworks that
  connect theory with real-world applications. I also pursue improvements in software
  for experimental settings, like the OM (OnDA Monitor) framework used in serial X-ray
  crystallography at synchrotrons and free-electron lasers. Here, I have implemented
  socket-based parallelization to enhance portability, reduce dependencies, and allow
  dynamic resumption after interruptions, maintaining key statistics. In future work,
  I plan to integrate neural network models â€“ such as convolutional neural networks
  for pattern recognition in diffraction data and graph neural networks for structural
  analysis â€“ alongside Bayesian optimization for parameter tuning and Monte Carlo
  methods for uncertainty assessment. With a drive to learn and explore, I aim to
  contribute to tools that advance structural biology and materials research, always
  seeking collaborative ways to make science more efficient.
motivation: I am requesting for attending the US-RSE 2025 conference through the Building
  Engagement program because it offers a unique opportunity to connect with the diverse
  community of research software engineering and learn from their insights and best
  practices, which will allow me to become a better researcher/developer in scientific
  computing. With my background in developing deep learning models for computational
  materials and planetary science â€“ such as using convolutional and graph neural
  networks to process spectroscopy data or physics-informed networks to incorporate
  symmetries in simulations â€“ I see this event as a platform to gain insights into
  scaling these approaches in high-performance environments. The program's focus on
  engagement and funding support would allow me to network with peers, learn from
  mentors, attend workshops on sustainable software development, and discuss challenges
  like optimizing distributed training for large-scale inverse problems. I hope to
  contribute my experiences while learning from others, aligning with my drive to
  build more efficient tools for domains like synchrotron experiments and quantum
  information science. This would directly support my goal of bridging AI with physics-driven
  discovery.
