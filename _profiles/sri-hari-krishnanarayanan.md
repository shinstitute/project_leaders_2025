title: AI-Based Adjoints to Diagnose the Sensitivity of Ocean Models to Parameters
topics: Computational Science Applications (i.e., bioscience, cosmology, chemistry,
  environmental science, nanotechnology, climate, etc.); High-Performance Computing;
  Machine Learning and AI
abstract: We are interested in understanding the sensitivities of an ocean model's
  output, to the model parameters. Estimating this sensitivity is very time consuming
  by brute force. Alternatively, adjoints have shown great promise in uncovering sensitivity
  of the model to its parameters. Yet adjoints are very time consuming to develop
  manually and very involved to develop via automatic differentiation (AD) for some
  models. Because neural networks implemented in machine learning frameworks can be
  differentiated trivially, we have want to explore how to generate an accurate neural
  network (NN) surrogate for an ocean model. We then use our NN model to generate
  adjoint versions of the original model.
