name: Mark Taylor
organization: Sandia National Laboratories
title: visualization for atmospheric simulation output
topics: Computational Science Applications (i.e., bioscience, cosmology, chemistry,
  environmental science, nanotechnology, climate, etc.); Data Science (i.e., data
  analytics, data management &amp; storage systems, visualization)
abstract: Produce visualizations from high resolution E3SM global climate simulations.
  Using python and matplotlib and large E3SM 3km global atmosphere data sets, Find
  interesting phenomena in the data sets, such as tropical cyclones, atmospheric rivers
  and mesoscale cloud systems. Plot various fields such as total water content, precipitation
  rate, cloud reflectivity, superimposed on images of the earth showing oceans and
  land masks. Generate high resolution publication quality images and animations suitable
  for use in journal articles, presentations and E3SM publicity.
