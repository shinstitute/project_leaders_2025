layout: profile
name: Jianna Gapuz
organization: San Diego State University
department: College of Sciences
status: Accept (Confirmed)
academic_interests: My academic and research interests lie at the intersection of
  computer vision, robotics, and computational biology. In computer vision, I have
  conducted research on ORB-SLAM3, focusing on developing and evaluating spatial masking
  techniques to improve pose estimation accuracy and performance. In computational
  biology, I work extensively in bioinformatics, particularly on projects involving
  molecular glues and protein folding. This includes designing and analyzing pipelines
  for degron prediction, integrating sequence, structural, and functional data to
  support drug discovery and protein function studies.
motivation: I am interested in attending the US-RSE25 Building Engagement program
  because my work sits at the intersection of software engineering and computational
  science. In my research, I have developed both specialized and broadly applicable
  software tools; from implementing spatial masking strategies in ORB-SLAM to building
  modular bioinformatics pipelines for molecular glue and protein folding studies.
  I value not only the technical side of research software engineering but also science
  communication, drawing from my experience as a tutor to make complex tools and concepts
  more accessible. Attending US-RSE25 would allow me to connect with the broader RSE
  community, learn best practices for creating impactful, user-centered research software,
  and explore how to scale my skills to projects that can serve both the research
  community and wider audiences.
