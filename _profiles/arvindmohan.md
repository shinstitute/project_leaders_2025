abstract: Climate change is already causing more frequent and severe extreme weather
  events, such as hurricanes, floods, droughts, and wildfires. These events can have
  devastating impacts on communities, livelihoods, and infrastructure. Machine learning
  has become an attractive alternative to developing fast surrogate models of these
  phenomena. ML surrogate models can help decision-makers better understand and respond
  to these events and mitigate their consequences. To be valid, these models need
  to a) Predict the likelihood and severity of future climate disasters and b) Assess
  the vulnerability of communities and infrastructure to climate disasters. c) Be
  robust and reliable for trustworthiness. However, there are many fundamental challenges
  to making ML models helpful in this area, and the summer project will focus on developing
  methods to address this issue. The topic is open-ended, and the student will have
  the opportunity to pick a specific direction of their liking.
