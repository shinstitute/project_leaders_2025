nairr_project: 'Enhancing Privacy-Preserving LLM Pipelines: Expanding Benchmarks,
  Improving Local Model Performance, and Exploring Complex System Structures'
topical_areas: Artificial Intelligence and Intelligent Systems; Computer Science
abstract: This project investigates privacy-preserving methods for Large Language
  Model (LLM) applications, focusing on preventing the disclosure of Personally Identifiable
  Information (PII) to untrusted LLMs at inference time. Building upon the previously
  developed PAPILLON pipeline, which leverages trusted but weaker local models to
  selectively utilize untrusted but powerful API-based models, this research aims
  to enhance the pipeline's capabilities and address limitations. The project will
  involve expanding the existing PUPA benchmark dataset with synthetic data and additional
  real-world conversations, improving the performance of smaller local LLMs through
  techniques like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization
  (DPO), and exploring more complex system structures for handling intricate user
  requests. Additionally, a user study will be conducted to investigate the discrepancies
  between human and LLM understandings of PII, contributing to better alignment between
  user expectations and model behavior
desired_skills: NLP and ML experience. Python coding experience
