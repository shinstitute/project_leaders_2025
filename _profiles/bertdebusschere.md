title: Uncertainty Quantification in Computational Simulations
topics: Computational Science Applications (i.e., bioscience, cosmology, chemistry,
  environmental science, nanotechnology, climate, etc.); Computer Science (i.e., architectures,
  compilers/languages, networks, workflow/edge, experiment automation, containers,
  neuromorphic computing, programming models, operating systems, sustainable software);
  Data Science (i.e., data analytics, data management &amp; storage systems, visualization);
  High-Performance Computing; Machine Learning and AI
abstract: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is the assessment of the confidence in we
  can have in computational results based on the uncertainty in the model and its
  input parameters. It also involves the calibration of models based on information
  in available data sets. Our workgroup focuses on the development and implementation
  of UQ methods in open-source software, as well as the application of these methods
  to relevant problems in computational sciences. We are looking for 1 â€“ 2 interns
  to help with the software engineering of our Python open-source UQ tools, as well
  as the application of these tools to studies in nuclear fusion energy.
