biography: Dr. Zhe Zhang is an Associate Professor in the Department of Geography
  at Texas A&M University. Dr. Zhang has served as Chair of the Cyberinfrastructure
  Specialty Group of the American Association of Geographers and was elected to the
  Board of Directors of the Cartography and Geographic Information Society. She also
  serves as Chair of the Research Committee of the University Consortium for Geographic
  Information Science. Her research focuses on developing spatial decision support
  systems by integrating advanced cyberinfrastructure, geospatial artificial intelligence,
  and participatory design to address critical challenges in disaster management and
  sustainability. Dr. Zhang serves as the Co-Principal Investigator of the Texas A&M
  FASTER High-Performance Supercomputer (over $3 million) and as a Co-Investigator
  of the Texas A&M ACES Supercomputer (over $12 million), both supported by the NSF.
  In addition, she serves as Principal Investigator on eight externally funded grants
  from (NSF, NASA, USDOT, NOAA, and National Geographic Society), totaling over $3
  million. Dr. Zhang has been honored to receive both the Pathways Award from Texas
  A&M Faculty Affairs and the National Science Foundation CAREER Award in recognition
  of her impactful research.

abstract: The Gulf of America faces significant challenges for Blue Economy research,
  including environmental degradation from pollution and overfishing, as well as the
  impacts of natural disasters. These issues strain marine ecosystems and coastal
  communities, creating barriers to sustainability. Similarly, the mid-Atlantic region,
  such as Maryland, suffers from agriculture, urban runoff, and industrial activities
  that degrade water quality and significantly impact fish populations and the overall
  health of the fishery. Hawaii, meanwhile, encounters unique challenges due to its
  geographic isolation and heavy reliance on ocean resources. This project aims to
  address these challenges by establishing coordinated efforts to improve Blue Economy
  research in these regions, enhancing funding for innovative research, and strengthening
  partnerships across sectors to build a Blue Economy research network. This project
  will bring together students, faculty, and researchers from U.S. institutions, along
  with participants from broad fields, including GIScience, oceanography, computer
  science, biology, and civil engineering. The goal is to promote AI education and
  workforce development in Blue Economy research. Nowadays, AI has transformative
  potential to enhance blue economy research by providing advanced tools for data
  analysis, modeling, and decision-making.
desired_skills: The workshop will offer training opportunities to help research communities
  effectively navigate NAIRR pilot resources, including learning how to access and
  use these resources for ocean and coastal sustainability analysis. All workshop
  and training materials will be made publicly available through a project GitHub
  repository and website, ensuring broad accessibility and ongoing learning opportunities.
  Participants will learn skills of cyberinfrastructure and high-performance computing,
  oceanography, disaster management, and coastal resilience planning.
