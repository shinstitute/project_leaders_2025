name: Clement Bosomtwe
organization: Shorter College
department: Computer Science
status: Accept (Confirmed)
academic_interests: My academic and research interests are shaped by both my experiences
  in Ghana and my current studies in the United States. Growing up in Ghana, I witnessed
  firsthand the challenges faced by developing regions, particularly in areas such
  as data security, reliable digital systems, and access to efficient technological
  solutions. These experiences sparked my passion for technology as a tool for solving
  real-world problems. Currently, as a Computer Science student in the U.S. at Shorter
  College, I am deeply engaged in areas such as artificial intelligence, cybersecurity,
  and software development. I am especially interested in researching how AI and machine
  learning can be used to strengthen data protection, improve system efficiency, and
  enhance decision-making processes. My experiences in Ghana give me a unique perspective,
  motivating me to design solutions that are not only innovative but also practical
  and accessible in resource-limited environments. Additionally, I am interested in
  studying the intersection of technology and society, particularly how digital systems
  can empower individuals and communities. My goal is to contribute to research that
  explores secure software solutions, advanced data protection methods, and scalable
  systems that can be applied both in the United States and globally, with a focus
  on developing regions like Ghana. Through academic research and practical projects,
  I aim to establish a foundation that enables me to develop impactful technological
  solutions that enhance lives, promote innovation, and bridge the digital divide.
motivation: I am interested in attending the US-RSE25 Building Engagement program
  to strengthen my skills in research software engineering, expand my professional
  network, and learn best practices from experts. This opportunity will enhance my
  ability to contribute to collaborative, impactful projects in computer science,
  particularly in artificial intelligence and cybersecurity, while preparing me to
  support and inspire others in STEM fields. Engaging with diverse peers and mentors
  will help me grow academically, professionally, and as a future software engineer.
