abstract: Robotic surgery presents many motivating challenges for computing research.
  Robotic surgery is an interface between surgeons and patients, much in the way motor
  vehicles are becoming less mechanic, and more of an interface between drivers and
  the road. In driving, optical and radar sensors coupled with automated warning,
  braking, and steering actions have dramatically increased motor-vehicle safety.
  We expect a similar development of technologies that prevent mistakes and improve
  outcomes in surgery. We are partnered with the Surgical Innovation and Training
  Lab at the University of Illinois at Chicago, with access to a robotic surgery research
  kit, expert annotated surgery videos, and medical expert collaborators. Our research
  efforts include instrument detection and segmentation, depth estimation, instrument
  tracking and kinematic estimation, and skill estimation applied to robotic surgery.
  We are particularly interested in exploring foundation models, vision language,
  and vision language action models for robotic surgery tasks.
