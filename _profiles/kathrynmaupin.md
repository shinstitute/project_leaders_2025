abstract: Despite continuing advances in statistical inversion and modeling, model
  inadequacy due to model form error remains a concern in all areas of mathematical
  modeling. The Bayesian paradigm naturally integrates uncertainties from both experimental
  data and model formulation, including initial or boundary conditions, model form,
  and parameter and numerical approximation. While model improvement is an enterprise
  that is continuously enabled by the availability of cost-effective high-performance
  computing infrastructure, model error is unavoidable in many situations. This problem
  is attributed to the incomplete understanding of the underlying physics, likely
  in addition to large and poorly characterized uncertainties in calibration and validation
  data. Introducing a model discrepancy term into the Bayesian framework can improve
  the predictive power of a given model and, arguably, the transferability of physical
  parameters. Much like physical models, calibrating a discrepancy model requires
  careful consideration regarding formulation, parameter estimation, and uncertainty
  quantification, each of which is often problem-specific. This project seeks to explore
  methods for model form error quantification that can be easily generalized for wide
  applicability. Of particular interest are methods that may enable physics discovery
  and enhance extrapolation.
