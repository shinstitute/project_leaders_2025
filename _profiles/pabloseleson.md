title: Peridynamics Modeling and Simulation for Exascale Fracture Computations
topics: Computational Science Applications (i.e., bioscience, cosmology, chemistry,
  environmental science, nanotechnology, climate, etc.); High-Performance Computing
abstract: 'Computational fracture modeling is an ongoing challenge in computational
  science and engineering. Peridynamics is a nonlocal reformulation of classical continuum
  mechanics designed to simulate fractures thus making it an attractive framework
  for modeling material failure and damage across many application domains. This has
  been reflected in an exponential growth in the number of peridynamics researchers
  and publications worldwide over the last two decades. We have developed at Oak Ridge
  National Laboratory (ORNL) an exascale-capable, GPU-enabled, and performance-portable
  peridynamics code, CabanaPD (https://github.com/ORNL/CabanaPD). CabanaPD has been
  tested on the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility (OLCF) leadership-class computing
  resources, Summit and Frontier supercomputers, and is built on two main libraries:
  Kokkos and Cabana, both developed through the Exascale Computing Project (ECP).
  This project will develop mathematical and computational methods to advance the
  state of the art of peridynamics modeling and simulation, with the end goal of enhancing
  current features of the peridynamics CabanaPD code.'
