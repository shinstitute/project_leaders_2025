  Computing; Machine Learning and AI
abstract: "DOE research often involves discovering new, â€œinterestingâ€\x9D events
  in high-fidelity physics-based HPC simulations. Standard anomaly detection algorithms
  are limited, requiring the capture of all the data for post processing, or requiring
  high-bandwidth in-situ communication. Our research focuses on creating more efficient
  ways to detect anomalies in-situ, thus facilitating more precisely targeted event
  capture."
