project_title: 'Interactive Grit Tracker: A Tool for Mentoring STEM Resilience'
status: Accept (Confirmed)
abstract: The poster will present the Interactive Grit Tracker, a web-based tool designed
  to support mentoring for NSF STEM in rural Louisiana. Built using Python and JavaScript,
  the tool allows mentors and students to input challenges, like financial stress
  or time constraints, and resilience strategies, like tutoring or peer support, generating
  real-time visualizations like bar charts to track progress. Drawing form an NSF
  S-STEM photovoice project, the tracker uses student narratives to foster academic
  confidence and belonging, addressing retention gaps in underserved communities.
  The poster will showcase the toolâ€™s interface, a sample output, and its potential
  to enhance mentoring practices.
academic_interests: I am pursuing a BS, double majoring in Computer Science, and Mathematics
  with a concentration in Data Science. I intend to continue my studies after receiving
  my undergraduate degree in Spring 2026. It is my longterm goal to work for a national
  laboratory, with a supercomputer, so that I can be a part of cutting edge, innovative
  research. Currently, I am participating in research on the photovoice/mentoring
  part of the NSF S-STEM scholar program at LSUA. I would love to participate in research
  projects on artificial intelligence, data science, and computational chemistry.
  Previous workshops held by SHI were very inspirational, and motivated me to work
  towards these goals.
motivation: I'm eager to attend this conference to connect with peers and grow my
  skillset.

additional_comments: As LSUA Math Club President, I lead STEM tutoring programs, participate
  in NSF-STEM research and take part in leadership conferences, sharpening my facilitation
  and communication skills, ideal for collaborating with project teams and clients.
  My academic coursework, including Software Development, Data Structures and Algorithms,
  Data Mining, Linear Algebra and Numerical Analysis I, has provided hands-on experience
  in extracting patterns from large datasets and developing algorithms using Python
  and MATLAB, al. I am eager to leverage my leadership, technical skills, and process
  optimization expertise to contribute to engagements that shape history.
