motivation: I am interested in attending the US-RSE25 Conference Building Engagement
  program because I believe in the importance of tying research back to the problems
  we are trying to solve. I want to see how real-life issues are first mentioned and
  how software engineers conduct research and then build tools to tackle them. In
  short, I want to surround myself with professionals and adopt more practical mindset.
