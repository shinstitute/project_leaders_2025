title: User Experience for Scientific Software Applications
topics: Computer Science (i.e., architectures, compilers/languages, networks, workflow/edge,
  experiment automation, containers, neuromorphic computing, programming models, operating
  systems, sustainable software); Data Science (i.e., data analytics, data management
  &amp; storage systems, visualization)
abstract: User experience design is frequently an afterthought for scientific software
  applications. Nonetheless, the actual experience a person has while using a piece
  of software can often make or break its success. Our team is working to make sure
  that every scientific team has the ability to build software applications that are
  intelligently designed, highly usable, and effective for its users. We are in the
  process of building a suite of design and software tools that break scientific processes
  into their most repeatable components and task flows. The goal is for these components
  and task flows to be the building blocks for new scientific applications. This means
  we are building both visual designs and actual code that teams will base their applications
  around. These tools have the potential to transform the way scientific teams approach
  the design of software and user interfaces. We are working with people from a breadth
  of scientific areas because these tools are meant to span the whole scientific domain.
  For example, we are or will be collaborating with teams in environmental science,
  water optimization, materials science, genomics, computer science, and physics.
