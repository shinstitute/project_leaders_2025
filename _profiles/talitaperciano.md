abstract: A graphical model or probabilistic graphical model (PGM) or structured probabilistic
  model is a probabilistic model for which a graph expresses the conditional dependence
  structure between random variables. They are commonly used in probability theory,
  statisticsâ€”particularly Bayesian statisticsâ€”and machine learning. One of the
  main advantages about this techniques is its ability to use prior information (physical
  constraints) related to the data. This becomes very important when analyzing scientific
  data. This project aims to develop efficient PGM-based algorithms to tackle problems
  such as image segmentation, image denoising, feature tracking, data reduction, data
  fusion, etc. We use mainly Markov Random Fields and Conditional Random Fields, and
  some of our approaches combine these methods with deep learning algorithms. Quantum
  computing is a research area that has received a great amount of attention in the
  last few years. In this project, we aim to take advantage of quantum computing theory
  to develop quantum data analysis and quantum machine learning tools suitable to
  the analysis of scientific data. This includes the development of new quantum circuits
  for quantum data representation and for analysis algorithms (feature extraction,
  template matching). We also aim to develop innovative quantum machine learning algorithms
  targeting/combining NISQ devices and HPC. We aim to develop concrete proof-of-concept
  tools that run on NISQ devices.
