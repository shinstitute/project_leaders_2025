abstract: Quantum dynamical simulations can predict important properties like opacity
  and conductivity that govern how materials interact with light and electric fields.
  In addition to materials engineering applications like solar cells, these properties
  determine the behavior of fusion energy experiments. State-of-the-art simulation
  techniques for computing these properties are run on supercomputers and still require
  many physical and numerical approximations that degrade accuracy in favor of feasibility.
  Someday, quantum computers may allow more efficient and precise calculations, but
  requisite algorithms are still being developed and analyzed. This project will characterize
  the numerical behavior of dynamical simulations of model systems and help inform
  methodological improvements and limitations for both classical and quantum computers,
  or explore another relevant aspect of mutual interest.
